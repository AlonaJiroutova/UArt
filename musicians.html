              A distinguished Ukrainian composer, pianist, choral conductor, folklorist, educator, and public figure,
              Mykola Lysenko

              Mykola Lysenko was born into a respected and longstanding Cossack family. He showed a natural talent for
              music from an
              early age, even publishing his first composition, a polka, at the age of nine. However, Lysenko initially
              did not pursue
              a career in music, instead focusing on science. In 1859, he graduated from the gymnasium in Kharkiv, and
              that same year,
              he and Starytskyi enrolled in the faculty of natural sciences at Kharkiv University. <br /><br />When the
              Lysenko family relocated to Kyiv, both Mykola and Starytskyi transferred to Kyiv University. There, Mykola
              defended his dissertation on the reproduction of filamentous algae and earned a candidate degree in
              natural sciences.
            </p>
            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>
              After completing his studies in Kyiv, Lysenko chose to pursue a professional career in music and began his
              formal
              education in the field. In 1867, he enrolled in the Leipzig Conservatory. During this time, he actively
              promoted
              Ukrainian culture in Europe by publishing two collections of folk songs, romances based on Shevchenko's
              poetry, and
              overtures. On December 28 of the same year, Lysenko gave a successful concert in Prague, where he
              showcased Ukrainian
              songs arranged for piano. Upon graduating from the conservatory, Mykola Lysenko was expected to have a
              thriving career
              as a pianist in Germany, but he ultimately decided to return to Ukraine.</p>

            <p> In 1875, Mykola Lysenko traveled to Saint Petersburg to further refine his skills in the class of
              Nikolai
              Rimsky-Korsakov. After completing his studies, he composed some of his finest operas. Despite being
              offered a position
              as a kapellmeister in a private opera and the opportunity to join the Imperial stage in russia, Lysenko
              declined and
              chose to return to Kyiv.

                Lysenko had long envisioned creating a heroic opera based on Mykola Gogol's novel, but this idea
                solidified during
                archaeological excavations at the site of the former Zaporozhian Sich. The libretto for the opera was
                written by
                Starytskyi, and Lysenko spent 10 years working on Taras Bulba. Both Pyotr Tchaikovsky and
                Rimsky-Korsakov praised
                Lysenko's work and suggested staging it at the Imperial theater in Saint Petersburg, with the condition
                that the opera
                be translated into russian. Lysenko refused. Consequently, Taras Bulba was never performed during
                Lysenko's lifetime.
                The exact reason remains unclear, though Mykhailo Starytskyi speculated it was due to Lysenko's modesty.
                However, given
                the imperial government's stance on Ukrainian culture, it's likely that Lysenko was prohibited from
                doing so. He was
                even unable to publish the opera's orchestral score.
              </p>

            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>
              He composed ten operas, including "Christmas Night", "Natalka Poltavka", and "Taras Bulba" (a masterpiece
              of Ukrainian opera),
              as well as children’s operas like "Koza Dereza" and "Pan Kotskyi", and the operetta "Chornomortsi".
              Lysenko was deeply
              inspired by Shevchenko, leading him to create the unique work Music to the Kobzar, which includes around
              one hundred
              cantatas for choirs, ensembles, and solo voices. Additionally, he wrote numerous piano pieces (including
              two
              rhapsodies), choruses, and romances set to poems by Ivan Franko, Lesia Ukrayinka, Oleksandr Oles, Mykhaylo
              Starytskyi,
              Heinrich Heine, Adam Mickiewicz, and others.

              Lysenko's strong pro-Ukrainian stance, especially in his art, prevented him from achieving a distinguished
              career as a
              composer. Despite facing language restrictions and persecution from the tsarist government, his creative
              work continued
              to thrive. Throughout his life, Lysenko supported himself by teaching music.
              <br /><br />Mykhailo Starytskyi remarked that while Lysenko's strong convictions and genuine talent
              garnered him admiration and
              respect from his homeland, they also led to material hardship and significant blows to his self-esteem.
              These challenges
              hindered his career advancement.
              <br /><br />
              Mykola Lysenko planted a crucial foundation for Ukrainian classical music and culture. Despite facing
              centuries of
              anti-Ukrainian policies, his work has endured and is now celebrated both in Ukraine and internationally.
              Today,
              Lysenko's compositions are performed in philharmonic societies and theaters across Ukraine, including in
              Lviv, Kyiv, and
              Odesa, as well as in countries such as South Korea, Sweden, and Italy. (<a class="source-link"

              <p class="artist-first-p">
                Solomiya Krushelnytska's early life was far removed from the glamour and acclaim of the opera world. She
                was born in
                Biliavyntsi, a small village nestled in the Ukrainian countryside. Her family belonged to the lower
                Ukrainian nobility,
                with her father serving as a priest in the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. When she was five, her
                family relocated to a
                village near Ternopil, where Krushelnytska first appeared on stage at just eleven years old. Her
                extraordinary vocal
                talent quickly drew attention and acclaim.
                <br /><br />
                Although an artistic career was deemed unsuitable for the daughter of a priest, Solomiya's father
                recognized her
                exceptional talent and used their last savings to send her to Lviv. There, she enrolled in the
                conservatory, studying
                both piano and vocal music. In 1893, she graduated with distinction and made a triumphant debut on April
                15 at the
                Skarbek Theatre in Lviv, performing as Leonora in Donizetti's "La favorita." She also found acclaim in
                the role of
                Santuzza in "Cavalleria rusticana." A pivotal moment in her career came when the renowned Italian
                soprano Gemma
                Bellincioni visited Lviv that year. Impressed by Krushelnytska's talent, Bellincioni advised her to move
                to Italy,
                believing it was the key to achieving international fame.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>
              With Bellincioni’s encouragement, Krushelnytska journeyed to Italy, where she advanced her opera education
              both
              academically and on stage in Milan. By the early 1900s, her career had reached dazzling heights. From 1900
              to 1939,
              Solomiya Krushelnytska achieved extraordinary artistic success, performing 63 roles in eight different
              languages. She
              graced the stages of major opera houses across northern Africa, North America, South America, and Europe.
              In the early
              1920s, she shifted her focus from opera to embark on a highly successful concert career.
              <br /><br />
              In February 1904, the renowned Italian composer Giacomo Puccini unveiled "Madama Butterfly" at La Scala,
              but the
              premiere was a dismal failure, with the capricious Italian audience reacting with scorn and boos. Puccini
              turned to
              Solomiya Krushelnytska for help, and she agreed to take on the challenge. Although she suggested that
              Puccini shorten
              the opening aria, which she believed was tiresome for the audience, she took the risk. In May, the revised
              version
              premiered at the Grande Theatre in Brescia, achieving remarkable success. Puccini and Krushelnytska were
              called back for
              encores seven times. Krushelnytska went on to perform the role of the famous geisha in major theaters
              worldwide over a
              hundred times and is still celebrated as the finest interpreter of Cio-Cio-San.

              In Italy and Poland, Ukrainian singer Solomiya Krushelnytska was embraced as their own national treasure,
              yet she
              consistently emphasized her Ukrainian identity. She always concluded her solo concerts with Ukrainian folk
              songs,
              proudly showcasing her heritage. "Everyone knows my nationality, and I have never changed it, despite the
              fact that
              flattery and aligning with the stronger side might sometimes be beneficial," Krushelnytska stated. Despite
              her
              international stardom on the world's greatest opera stages, she made it a point to return each year to
              perform in her
              hometowns, including Ternopil, Lviv, Berezhany, Chernivtsi, and Zbarazh.

              In August 1939, following her husband's death, Solomiya Krushelnytska traveled to Galycia to visit her
              relatives,
              bringing only two suitcases with her. However, with the onset of World War II, she was unable to return to
              Italy. The
              reasons for her staying behind during the German occupation remain unclear. While her friend Negrita Cano
              de Piacentini
              extended an invitation for her to come to Argentina, it was Solomiya's sister, Emiliya Sterniuk, and her
              family who
              ultimately accepted the offer. <br /><br />
              During the Soviet occupation, Solomiya Krushelnytska’s home was nationalized, leaving her and her sister
              Hanna with only
              a top-floor apartment. To make a living during the German occupation, she offered private vocal lessons
              for a fee. After
              the war, Krushelnytska began teaching at the Lviv Conservatory but faced nearly being dismissed due to the
              disappearance
              of her higher education diploma. She was prohibited from returning to Italy, denied Soviet citizenship,
              and refused a
              pension until she surrendered her Tuscan villa to the Soviet state, which subsequently sold it. Despite
              her remarkable
              talent and voice, Krushelnytska’s life and career were constrained behind the "Iron Curtain."

            <p>
              Solomiya Krushelnytska gave her final concert in Lviv at the age of 77. Although her voice had lost some
              of its former
              strength, it remained clear as she performed "Rodimyi Kraiu" at the Lviv Philharmonic. She stayed involved
              in music
              until her death. Even as she battled throat cancer at 79, from April 8 to 16, 1951, she recorded four
              pieces,
              arrangements of Ukrainian songs by Andriy Shtoharenko, Stanislav Lyudkevych, Boris Lyatoshynsky, and
              Viktor Matyuk.
              Today, her legacy is honored with two memorial museums in Ukraine, one in Lviv and one in Bila, Ternopil
              region. Streets
              in Kyiv, Lviv, Ternopil, Rivne, Zhytomyr, and Buchach bear her name. Additionally, in La Scala’s grand
              hall, among
              portraits of renowned Italians such as Roger Leoncavallo and Enrico Caruso, there is a relief sculpture
              dedicated to the
              great Ukrainian artist, Solomiya Krushelnytska. (<a class="source-link"

              Ukrainian composer, choir conductor, pianist, teacher, and collector of musical folklore, he is renowned

              Mykola Leontovych was born in the village of Monastyrok, Vinnytsia Oblast. His father, a village
              priest with proficiency in the cello, violin, and guitar, gave him his initial music education. Leontovych
              went to the
              district primary school in Sharhorod and then studied at the theological seminary in Kamianets-Podilskyi
              from 1892 to
              1899. There, he explored Ukrainian music and began working on choral arrangements. After graduating, he
              did not become
              a priest but chose teaching as his profession.

            <p>
              For two decades, Mykola Leontovych taught voice and music in public and theological schools across
              Podillya and Donbas,
              including Chukiv, Vinnytsia, Tulchyn, and Hryshyne. He continued his musical education in St. Petersburg
              from 1903 to
              1904, where he sang with the Court Choir and obtained qualifications as a church choir director. During
              the 1905
              revolution, he formed a workers' choir that performed at rallies, drawing the attention of the authorities
              and prompting
              his return to Podillya. In Tulchyn, he taught music and singing at a diocesan women's school for the
              daughters of
              village priests. Starting in 1909, Leontovych studied composition with the renowned Boleslav Yavorskyi,
              whom he visited
              periodically in Moscow and Kyiv. It was under Yavorskyi's guidance that Leontovych created his famous
              arrangement of the
              folk song Shchedryk (also known as Carol of the Bells), which remains highly popular today.

              Alongside his teaching career, Leontovych was deeply involved in musical and organizational activities. He founded and
              directed amateur choirs and orchestras, organized musical performances, and promoted choral arts. He composed numerous
              choral arrangements of Ukrainian folk songs, including Dudaryk (The Piper) and Mother Had Only One Daughter. In 1901 and
              1903, he published two collections of Podillya folk song arrangements for unaccompanied choirs. In 1916, following an
              invitation from Kyrylo Stetsenko, Pylyp Kozytskyi, and Oleksandr Koshyts, he presented his arrangement of Shchedryk with
              full choir accompaniment in Kyiv, where it received widespread acclaim.

              During the brief period of Ukrainian Independence in 1918-1919, Leontovych relocated from Tulchyn to Kyiv, where he
              became actively involved as a conductor and composer. His works were performed by both professional and amateur
              ensembles throughout Ukraine. His original composition, "Legend" by Mykola Voronoi, was particularly well-received at
              one concert. After the Bolsheviks took control, Leontovych worked with the music committee of the People's Commissariat
              of Education, taught at the Mykola Lysenko Music and Drama Institute, and collaborated with composer and conductor
              Hryhoriy Veryovka at the People's Conservatory. He also contributed to preschool education courses and organized several
              choir groups. Following Kyiv's capture by the Denikinites on August 31, 1919, who targeted Ukrainian intellectuals, he
              was forced to return to Tulchyn, where he established the first music school in the city.

              Between 1919 and 1920, Leontovych focused on his first significant symphonic project, the folk-fantasy opera "To the
              Little Mermaid Easter," inspired by Borys Grinchenko's fairy tale of the same name. In the autumn of 1920, a choir tour
              was organized in Tulchyn, led by Kyril Stetsenko, with Pavel Tychyna serving as the second conductor. During this tour,
              the choir performed several of Leontovych's compositions.

              district. He was killed by Athanasius Hryshchenko, a Cheka agent (Soviet state security), who had requested to stay the
              night, claiming to be a Chekist combating banditry. The following morning, Hryshchenko robbed the house and murdered
              Leontovych. The identity of Leontovych's killer was not revealed until a report disclosing his name was made public in

              Volodymyr Ivasiuk was born in Bukovyna, in the village of
              Kitsman, to teachers Mykhailo and Sofia Ivasyuk. His father was
              fluent in six languages and wrote prose and poetry, including
              about the Holodomor. When he was young, Mykhailo was imprisoned
              in Soviet camps for trying to cross the Romanian-Soviet border
              because he wanted to go to university. Therefore, the family was
              "penciled in" by the KGB as "unreliable." From an early age,
              Volodymyr was drawn to music; at the age of three, his greatest
              pleasure was rehearsing in the teacher's choir, where his
              parents took him. At the age of five, he began to learn to play
              the violin.

              Volodymyr Ivasiuk would have graduated from high school with a
              gold medal if not for an unfortunate incident: in the tenth
              grade, he and his friends were walking in a park, and someone
              threw a hat on a plaster bust of Lenin. When he tried to remove
              the loose bust, it fell off the pedestal and broke. Everyone was
              taken to the police, the "Volodymyr Ivasiuk case" was opened,
              and the question arose of his expulsion from the Komsomol and
              expulsion from school. Eventually, the scandal was hushed up,
              but he got Bs in his school certificate in Soviet history and
              social studies. <br /><br />The same story prevented him from
              becoming a student at the Chernivtsi Medical Institute, despite
              his brilliant entrance exams. Someone reported the "case" and on
              August 31, 1966, instead of Ivasiuk's student card, he received
              accusations that he had "dishonestly entered the ranks of Soviet
              students" and an expulsion order. So instead of going to medical
              school, Ivasyuk, an excellent student, goes to work at the local
              Legmash plant as a stamper in the hardware shop. There he
              created his first ensemble, "Bukovynka," together with fellow
              factory workers. Together with "Bukovynka," Ivasiuk made his
              debut on Kyiv television, and later, the then-popular singer
              Lidia Vidash recorded the song "I'll Go to the Far Mountains" on
              Ukrainian Radio, which was inspired by Volodymyr's ascent to
              Hoverla with his friends. The song immediately caught on with
              listeners and began to be played frequently on the air.

            <p>
              Only a year later, after receiving a recommendation from the
              Legmash factory, Ivasiuk became a student at the medical
              institute. Volodymyr Ivasiuk had two degrees. After graduating
              from the Chernivtsi Medical University, he entered the Lviv
              Conservatory to study composition.

              In fact, the performance on Chernivtsi's Theater Square became
              historic when Volodymyr Ivasiuk, together with Olena Kuznetsova,
              performed the song "Chervona Ruta" for the first time to the
              accompaniment of the Karpaty ensemble. The composition caused a
              sensation, the performance gathered a crowd of thousands on the
              square, and traffic stopped on the square and neighboring
              streets. The song "Chervona Ruta," which was broadcast live, was
              sung throughout Ukraine the next day. "Those whose youth was
              spent in the second half of the sixties," recalls singer Vasyl
              Zinkevych,"remember well how Volodymyr Ivasyuk's song "Chervona
              Ruta" flew out into the wide world like a spring whirlwind, like
              a swift bird.

              Dutkivsky, which are performed by the "Smerichka" ensemble and
              become extremely popular. Volodymyr writes songs and music for
              his friends, pop singers Nazariy Yaremchuk and Vasyl Zinkevych,
              and they travel together in the Carpathians. The filming of the
              first Ukrainian musical "Chervona Ruta" in Yaremche brings the
              young artists great popularity. The main roles were played by
              Sofia Rotaru and Vasyl Zinkevych, and many of Ivasiuk's songs
              were performed in the movie.

              with twelve songs by Ivasyuk performed by Rotaru - this was an
              unheard-of success for such young artists! Moreover, Ivasiuk, as
              a student, was not entitled to such a record; only members of
              the USSR Composers' Union had this right. Nevertheless, during
              1977-1978, it had as many as eight reissues. It was the world's
              first and only Ukrainian-language conceptual disc: the envelope
              design was thoughtfully designed, each subsequent song
              complemented the previous one and at the same time was an
              independent unit. Although many fans created romantic legends
              about them, the composer and the singer were connected only by
              their creative relationship.

              <p>Ivasyuk gained popularity in the United States, where his record was released. The artist received a
                fabulous fee and, at the same time, a conversation with the KGB. Ivasyuk was strongly advised to give
                the money to a certain "Peace Fund" that was engaged in "spreading socialism."
                The principled Ivasyuk replied that he would not finance "terrorist organizations."
                He kept silent only about the fact that he had not seen the American fee himself, because it was simply
                impossible to get it under the Iron Curtain.
                Later, he told his family and friends that the KGB was watching him. <br><br>
                "The authorities hoped that he, like everyone else, would pay tribute to Moscow. After all, he was
                Ukraine's favorite composer, and he could influence young people 'ideologically' like no other. But
                Volodymyr was uncompromising. He wanted to serve only the Ukrainian people. Time passed. Ivasyuk did not
                create anything to glorify the notorious "reunification." Instead, he began to write an opera from the
                Cossack era,".
                <br><br>"He was repeatedly asked why you write only Ukrainian. He said: "Because I am Ukrainian and I
                want to."

            <p class=" last-p">On April 24, 1979, Ivasyuk received a phone call in the afternoon, got dressed, went to
              the conservatory, and never returned.
              The day after he disappeared, his family raised the alarm, but, according to them, they were in no hurry
              to find Ivasyuk and refused to place an announcement on television about his disappearance.
              <br>On May 18, almost a month later, Volodymyr's body was found on the territory of a military unit in the
              Bryukhovychi forest: Ivasyuk was hanged by the belt of his coat. <br><br>
              Obituaries and condolences to Ivasyuk's family were banned from being published in newspapers. On the day
              of the funeral, Komsomol meetings were scheduled everywhere with mandatory attendance, and there were
              instructions threatening expulsion and dismissal of anyone who did not show up. But people could not be
              deterred. Thousands came to say goodbye to Ivasyuk.
              <br><br> "It was the first time people disobeyed the authorities. A kind of protest expressed by coming to
              the funeral. There were meetings in all organizations, Komsomol and trade union meetings, to prevent
              people from attending. It didn't work, so it looks like people were just protesting. I heard people say
              that, and I thought, why should you forbid me to go to the funeral? I'm going to go. And what will you do?
              If you do, we will fight. It was the first unauthorized rally before what happened later," says Krysa.

              <br><br>Ivasiuk's close friend, the poet Rostyslav Bratun, who was the first to speak over the coffin,
              lost his position as head of the Lviv organization of the Writers' Union and editor-in-chief of Zhovten
              magazine. Disgraced by the party structures, he remained unemployed for 17 years, until the end of his
              life. He was not published, not allowed to speak, and even attempted to be killed - hit in the head with
              brass knuckles near his mother's apartment in Kyiv. <br><br>
              Volodymyr Ivasiuk said: "We, Ukrainians, become nationalists from the cradle if our mothers sing us
              Ukrainian lullabies. That is why we are re-educated in concentration camps."
