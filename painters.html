                        <p class="main-info">Mykola Pymonenko was a Ukrainian painter known for his realist style. He
                            spent nearly his entire life in Kyiv, focusing
                            his artistic efforts on depicting everyday scenes. His paintings offer a vivid glimpse into
                            the life and culture of
                            19th-century Ukraine. Today, he is regarded as one of the most significant artists in
                            Ukrainian history.

                        <p>Mykola Pymonenko was born in the village of Priorka, Kyiv, which was part of the russian
                            rmpire at the time. Due to
                            this, he is frequently mislabeled as a russian painter, a fate that has befallen other
                            artists as well. It is crucial to
                            highlight, however, that Pymonenko was Ukrainian.
                            <br><br> He was the son of a woodcarver and an icon painter, often accompanying his father
                            who created altars and paintings for
                            churches. This exposure to rural life likely influenced his choice to pursue a career in
                            genre painting. Later on, he
                            began helping in his father's workshop. In 1873, he enrolled at the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra
                            (Kyiv Monastery of the Caves) to
                            study icon painting.<br><br>
                            Despite financial constraints preventing him from pursuing formal artistic education,
                            Pymonenko's talent quickly gained
                            recognition. In 1876, the renowned Ukrainian artist and art teacher Mykola Murashko noticed
                            his work and was clearly
                            impressed by it. Murashko offered him a spot at his Drawing School in Kyiv, even arranging
                            for his tuition to be waived.
                            Before long, Pymonenko distinguished himself as one of the school's top students. <br><br>

                            He then spent a short period studying at the russian Academy of Fine Arts in Saint
                            Petersburg (1882–1884). During this
                            time, he was also permitted to teach at lower-secondary schools and earned three silver
                            medals for his achievements.
                            However, due to health issues and financial difficulties, he was compelled to return to
                            Kyiv.
                        </p>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-1"></div>
                        <p>Upon returning home, he rejoined the Mykola Murashko Drawing School, this time as a teacher.
                            Unfortunately, the school
                            had to close a few years later. Consequently, in 1901, he began teaching drawing to
                            engineers at the Kyiv Polytechnic
                            Institute. At the same time, he co-founded and taught at the Kyiv Art School. Despite his
                            teaching commitments, he
                            continued to pursue painting. For instance, he joined The Peredvizhniki group, which opposed
                            the restrictions of the
                            Imperial Academy and later evolved into the Association of Traveling Exhibitions. <br><br>
                            A significant aspect of the artist’s work is his portrayal of the lyrical and distinctive
                            image of Ukraine, capturing
                            the charm of his homeland and its joyful people. This earned Mykola Pymonenko the title of
                            "master of genre painting."
                            Additionally, Pymonenko created historical paintings, often focusing on themes related to
                            the Cossacks, a renowned
                            self-governing and semi-military community in Ukraine. The Cossacks have been a national
                            symbol for Ukrainians since the
                            15th century. Furthermore, he also addressed social issues in his artwork.</p>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-1"></div>
                        <p>In 1909, he gained entry to one of Europe's most prestigious exhibitions when the Paris Salon
                            accepted his painting
                            Hopak, named after the traditional Ukrainian folk dance. He was awarded a gold medal by the
                            Society of French Artists,
                            and the Louvre promptly acquired the piece. Additionally, he exhibited his work in London,
                            Berlin, and Rome, and became
                            a member of several organizations in these cities.
                            <br><br>One of Pymonenko’s most notable students was Malevich, who ultimately developed a
                            very different artistic style.
                            However, some of Malevich's works clearly show Pymonenko’s influence. For example, as
                            Jean-Claude Marcadé points out,
                            the poses in Floor Polishers bear a resemblance to those in Hopak. Similarly, Malevich also
                            depicted peasants in his
                            art. Beyond Malevich, Pymonenko taught many future avant-garde painters, including Sergei
                            Kostenko, Olexander Murashko,
                            and even Lesya Ukrainka.

                        <p class="last-p">Unfortunately, Pymonenko's health issues persisted, and he passed away in
                            1912, being laid to rest at Lukyanivka
                            Cemetery. Despite his brief life, he left behind a substantial legacy. In addition to his
                            paintings, he created
                            illustrations for Taras Shevchenko’s poems. The year following his death, the Academy of
                            Arts held an exhibition
                            showcasing hundreds of his works, including oil paintings, sketches, and drawings. (<a

                        <p class="main-info">For more than 60 years, Maria Prymachenko created art deeply influenced by
                            her Ukrainian heritage and her vivid
                            imagination. Throughout her life, she gained recognition for her vividly colored and
                            imaginative depictions of animals.
                            Additionally, Prymachenko incorporated creative critiques on various significant social
                            events into her artwork. (<a class="source-link"

                        <p>Maria Prymachenko was raised in the scenic region of Polissya, near Kyiv. Lacking formal
                            artistic education, she drew
                            inspiration from the natural world. Despite facing challenges such as floods and droughts,
                            she persisted in her work,
                            sustained by a strong inner vision. <br><br>
                            Maria Prymachenko spent nearly her entire life in native village, seldom traveling far from
                            it. However, in her
                            imagination, she built a captivating universe that audiences can still explore and enjoy
                            today. Since a local museum
                            containing Prymachenko’s works was destroyed by russian forces, her paintings can now only
                            be viewed through
                            exhibitions. <br><br>
                            In times of war, Prymachenko's art served as a source of inspiration and strength for
                            Ukrainians. It offers a reminder
                            of their resilience, rich history, and the potential of their future. (<a

                        <div class="pattern pattern-2"></div>
                        <p>From her family, Prymachenko learned various traditional Ukrainian crafts, including
                            embroidery. She attended school for
                            four years but contracted polio, which left her with a physical disability that would
                            influence both her life and her
                            art. The experience of suffering from polio instilled in Prymachenko a deep empathy for
                            others' hardships, and her
                            compassion for all living beings became a significant theme in her artwork. Her artistic
                            inclinations emerged early; she
                            once recounted her first artistic endeavor, saying, <br>
                            <br>
                            “As a young girl, while tending a flock of geese, I arrived at a sandy riverbank after
                            crossing a field of wildflowers.
                            There, I began drawing real and imagined flowers in the sand with a stick… Later, I chose to
                            paint the walls of my house
                            with natural pigments. Since then, I have never stopped drawing and painting.”
                        </p>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-2"></div>
                        <p>In 1936, Prymachenko’s artwork was showcased in a dedicated hall at the First Republican
                            Exhibition of Folk Art. The
                            success of this exhibition paved the way for a series of successful shows in cities such as
                            Paris, Warsaw, Sofia,
                            Montreal, and Prague. At the 1937 Paris World Fair, she was honored with a gold medal. Pablo
                            Picasso, upon viewing her
                            work, remarked, “I bow down before the artistic miracle of this brilliant Ukrainian.” In
                            1970, Prymachenko was
                            recognized with the title of People’s Artist of Ukraine.</p>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-2"></div>
                        <p>Prymachenko’s paintings are categorized as “naïve art,” a term used to describe the work of
                            artists who lack formal art
                            education and are entirely self-taught, with limited reference to traditional art history.
                            Her sources of inspiration
                            and themes came from the decorative wall paintings common in Ukraine, as well as lullabies,
                            folk legends, fairy tales,
                            and the natural landscape around her. <br><br>
                            Prymachenko had a deep appreciation for color, which she used to infuse her paintings with
                            rhythmic shapes and vibrant
                            hues, crafting a heartfelt and energetic tribute to life. Her work seamlessly blended the
                            folk art influences from her
                            upbringing. She initially sketched the lines of her artwork with pencil before applying
                            gouache and watercolor paints.</p>

                            <p>Having endured numerous hardships and lost the father of her child during WWII,
                                Prymachenko channeled her art into
                                exploring the conflict between good and evil. She frequently represented this struggle
                                through a variety of beings,
                                including some fantastical creatures of her own creation. The theme of this moral
                                struggle is evident throughout her
                                work, with a consistent portrayal of good ultimately prevailing. <br><br>
                                Prymachenko’s art represents one of the most compelling and unblemished forms of
                                anti-war expression, similar to the
                                works of Norwegian textile artist Hannah Ryggen, whose tapestries conveyed radical
                                political messages against fascism,
                                nazism, and wartime atrocities. Many of Prymachenko's paintings emphasize anti-war and
                                pacifist themes through their
                                titles. One such work, which has become a significant symbol in the context of the
                                ongoing war in Ukraine and the
                                violence inflicted by russian forces, features a white dove with outstretched wings set
                                against a yellow, flower-filled
                                background. Titled "A Dove Has Spread Her Wings and Asks for Peace" (1982), this image
                                has been recently recreated as
                                street murals in St. Louis, Missouri, and San Francisco, with the message "Stop the War
                                on Ukraine," and has also been
                                projected onto a building in Oakland, California.

                            as one of the foremost artists of the 20th century. However, due to her birth into poverty
                            in a remote and lesser-known
                            village in Ukraine, her work was relatively unknown during her lifetime. (<a

                        <p>Kateryna Bilokur was born to a peasant family in the village of Bohdanivka, located in the
                            Poltava region. From a young
                            age, she started drawing using whatever materials she could find—sketching with a stick in
                            the snow, on rain-soaked
                            paths, or with charcoal on any surface that could hold a mark. <br><br>
                            Kateryna Bilokur utilized whatever materials were available to create paintings she
                            described as “born in her head.” She
                            crafted paintbrushes from cat tail fur and made paints using natural dyes, such as beet
                            juice, berries, onions,
                            viburnum, herbs, and other available resources.

                            Without formal education, her life was filled with relentless physical labor and household
                            duties. Despite these
                            challenges, her passion for painting was intense. She would often work tirelessly throughout
                            the day and then paint
                            through the night until exhaustion. <br><br>
                            Most of her works are characterized by intensely vivid, vibrant, and colorful depictions of
                            floral scenes, showcasing
                            abundant arrangements of flowers and fruits in their natural environments. <br>
                            The artist believed that “flowers, like people, have souls and are alive! And a flower that
                            has been picked is no longer
                            a flower.” For Kateryna Bilokur, flowers represented the pinnacle of existential beauty. She
                            never picked them, viewing
                            it as an act of murder. Instead, she would set up her easel and paint near clusters of
                            mallows or dahlia bushes. If
                            Bilokur wanted to paint a particular flower, she would walk for miles to find it.

                            <p>In the 1920s, she attempted to gain admission to art school, but her lack of proof or
                                certification of completing
                                "seven-year school" prevented her from succeeding. She wanted to leave the village,
                                which was unwelcoming to her
                                artistic talent, and immerse herself in a more supportive artistic community. <br><br>
                                Bilokur lived through the tragic events of Ukrainian history over the past century,
                                including the revolution, Holodomor,
                                and World War II. Despite these challenges, she managed to turn her bold aspiration of
                                becoming an artist into reality.
                                Even in the 1920s, as a young woman, she made a courageous and independent choice to
                                dedicate herself to painting. This
                                decision was a significant act of defiance against the conservative, patriarchal society
                                in which she spent her entire
                                life. <br><br>
                                Her parents reprimanded and degraded her for not agreeing to marry. These incidents
                                typically led to a prohibition on
                                her painting and the destruction of her artwork. <br> <br>

                                In the fall of 1934, Kateryna Bilokur, overcome with despair, fled to the river,
                                intending to end her life. She waded
                                into the freezing water up to her chest, bidding farewell to life...
                                <br><br>
                                In the spring of 1940, Kateryna Bilokur heard Oksana Petrusenko singing “Wasn’t I a
                                Viburnum in the Meadow” on the
                                radio. Deeply moved by the performance, Bilokur wrote a letter to the singer and
                                included a drawing of viburnum on a
                                piece of canvas. Petrusenko was impressed by the drawing and shared it with the artists
                                she knew.
                                Soon after, the Center of Folk Art instructed the regional department to locate Kateryna
                                Bilokur and review her works.
                                Consequently, in 1940, Kateryna Bilokur from Bohdanivka held her first solo exhibition
                                of 11 paintings at the Poltava
                                House of Folk Art.

                        <p class="last-p">After enduring years of repression, including "dekulakization," enforced
                            collectivization, and the Holodomor, Ukrainian
                            peasants were essentially restricted to their villages. They lacked passports until 1974 and
                            could only obtain
                            certificates from the district NKVD office with prior approval from the collective farm
                            chairman and local officials.
                            Consequently, Kateryna Bilokur never had a passport.<br><br>
                            In 1947, the artist was requested to paint a portrait of Stalin, which could have
                            significantly advanced her career.
                            However, Bilokur declined the offer.
                            <br>
                            The Soviet authorities characterized her art as "the work of a collective farmer from the
                            village of Bohdanivka." In
                            1954, three of Bilokur's paintings—“Tsar Colossus,” “Birch,” and “Collective Farm
                            Field”—were featured in the Soviet art
                            exhibition at the International Exhibition in Paris.

                            Upon viewing her work, Pablo Picasso remarked, “If we had an artist of this level, we would
                            make
                            the entire world talk about
                            her.” <br><br>
                            She passed away in 1961 and was laid to rest in her hometown. (<a class="source-link"

                                <p class="img-description">Kazimir Malevich, cca 1990</p>
                            </div>
                            <p> Malevich was born in Kyiv into a Polish Catholic family, which included fourteen
                                children. His father,
                                Severin Malewicz, worked as a sugar production engineer, leading the family to
                                frequently relocate between various
                                Ukrainian towns and sugar factories, including those in the Podillia, Kharkiv, and
                                Chernihiv regions.<br><br>
                                His father hoped that his son would follow in his footsteps and become a sugar engineer,
                                which led him to oppose Kazimir
                                Malevich's passion for painting. In contrast, his mother supported Malevich's artistic
                                pursuits and even bought him
                                professional brushes and paints herself. <br><br>
                                Kazimir Malevich's initial exposure to artists occurred in the town of Bilopillia,
                                Kharkiv province. In his memoirs, he
                                recalled, “The most renowned artists traveled from St. Petersburg to paint icons in the
                                cathedral. This was very
                                thrilling for us, as we had never seen living artists before.”<br><br>
                                Although Malevich graduated from an agronomic school to fulfill his father's wishes, he
                                pursued his passion for art by
                                studying amateur drawing in Konotop, where his family resided from 1894 to 1895.
                                Subsequently, he studied painting under
                                Mykola Pymonenko at the Kyiv Art School from 1895 to 1897.

                            </div>
                            <p>Ukrainian peasant huts adorned with paintings on white walls, which Malevich encountered
                                in Ukrainian villages, had a
                                profound influence on his Suprematism and other works. During his years in Kharkiv, from
                                the age of 12 to 15, he saw
                                decorated ovens and even witnessed the painting process firsthand. <br><br>

                                “The village was engaged in art (this word I did not know that time). They made things
                                that
                                I really liked. Here is the
                                secret of my sympathy for the peasants. I watched their work with great excitement and
                                helped them plaster the floor of
                                the house with clay and make patterns on the stoves. Beautifully depicted birds, horses
                                and
                                flowers. All paints were
                                made on site with various clays and blue. I tried to reproduce this art on the stove at
                                home, but failed. They said that
                                I spoiled a lot of things – fences, sheds and walls and so on.” <br><br>
                                Malevich had a keen interest in embroidery. He not only practiced embroidery himself but
                                also designed sketches that
                                were later used by folk craft artisans to create embroidered items. The embroidered
                                scarves, pillows, shawls, and
                                tablecloths made in the village of Verbivka in the Kyiv region were eventually sold in
                                Kyiv, Moscow, and Berlin.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-1"></div>

                        <p>Later, Malevich spent nearly a decade living in Kursk, where he married and worked on the
                            Kursk-Moscow Railway.
                            Throughout this time, he continued to paint and even set up a drawing class.
                            <br>
                            Malevich's marriage did not work out, and in 1905, he made his first unsuccessful attempt to
                            gain admission to the Moscow
                            School of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture. He then started studying at the studio of
                            Ivan Rerberg, an architect
                            and a founder of the Moscow Society of Artists. This connection introduced Malevich to
                            prominent painters and allowed
                            him to participate in the society's art exhibitions.

                        <p>
                            Malevich's exploration of the "cubo-futurist" style began during the early years of World
                            War I. In 1913, he designed
                            the set for the avant-garde opera Victory Over the Sun. The "Black Square," created by
                            Malevich for this production,
                            made its debut on stage, marking the inception of Suprematism, which Malevich described as
                            the pinnacle of artistic
                            evolution. He outlined three phases in the development of Suprematism: black, colored, and
                            white.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1918, Malevich removed color from his work, resulting in the creation of "White Square on
                            a White Background." He
                            described this piece as a symbol of the purity of human creative expression, marking the
                            attainment of a pictorial
                            absolute. Malevich declared that with this work, the mission of painting had reached its
                            fulfillment.

                            <p>From 1928 to 1930, Kazimir Malevich taught at the Kyiv Institute of Art, which had become
                                renowned as the "Ukrainian
                                Bauhaus." During this period, several of Malevich's articles on art innovation were
                                published in Ukrainian press,
                                including the journal New Generation (Kharkiv) and Almanac-garde (Kyiv).<br><br>

                                Malevich taught at the Pedagogical Faculty of the Kyiv Institute of Art, where he
                                addressed students' struggles with
                                realism and the psychological complexities of global cultural challenges, such as
                                internal inhibition and insecurity. He
                                referred to these issues as "neurasthenia painting" and "kolorostrahu." By analyzing his
                                students' work, Professor
                                Malevich aimed to identify how artistic effects might overshadow individual will and
                                sought to guide them in discovering
                                their own artistic direction by incorporating "additional elements" of cultural
                                experience. <br><br>
                                However, the onset of repression against the intelligentsia in Ukraine compelled
                                Malevich to return to Leningrad. As
                                political conditions in the USSR worsened, the artist anticipated the challenges he
                                would face in the Soviet Union. In
                                1927, he traveled to Poland and Germany, and his entire archive of work created before
                                March 1927 is now preserved in
                                Berlin. <br><br>
                                Like many notable figures in Ukrainian culture, Malevich fell victim to Stalinism.
                                Although he intended to relocate
                                permanently from Leningrad to Kyiv, Stalin's 1930s campaign against highly-qualified
                                professionals from different fields including art, branding them as
                                "bourgeois intellectuals," thwarted his plans. During this period, the Kyiv Art Academy
                                underwent a "purge" that removed
                                its distinguished professors and artists. <br><br>
                                In 1930, Malevich was detained and tortured by the Soviet OGPU in Leningrad. They
                                subjected him to severe abuse,
                                including pressurized water being forcefully sprayed into his urethra while pressuring
                                him to admit to espionage for
                                Poland. Malevich's health deteriorated due to prostate disease and other complications,
                                leading to his death on May 15, 1935.

                            <p class="last-p">Despite Kazimir Malevich's clear identification as Ukrainian, many sources
                                continue to label him as a “russian and
                                soviet” artist. This misattribution affects numerous prominent Ukrainians, including
                                artists, scientists, and
                                politicians. However, the truth persists despite the efforts of Russian propaganda.
                                Recently, the Metropolitan Museum of
                                Art in New York, one of the world's largest museums, updated its website to recognize
                                Arkhyp Kuindzhi, Illia Repin, and
                                Ivan Aivazovsky as Ukrainian artists. (<a class="source-link"

                            supporter of the arts in Galicia (Halychyna), a historical region in western Ukraine. He

                        <p>Ivan Trush came from a poor family, with his father working as a tailor. Despite their modest
                            means, his father played a
                            significant role in nurturing Ivan's creative talents and instilling in him a deep
                            appreciation for the beauty of nature
                            and the history of their homeland. <br><br>
                            In 1881, Trush enrolled at the Brodivska Gymnasium, where he excelled in watercolor painting
                            and stood out as the top
                            student. However, following his father's death, he had to abandon his studies to start
                            working. Despite these
                            challenges, Ivan remained determined to pursue his dream of becoming an artist. <br><br>
                            In 1891, Trush attended the School of Fine Arts in Krakow, a vibrant hub of artistic culture
                            that attracted many
                            artists. There, he was taught by notable figures such as Leon Vichulkovsky, Jan Matejko, and
                            Jan Stanislavsky. In 1894,
                            he traveled to Vienna, and three years later, he relocated to Munich to study at the Anton
                            Ažbe School.</p>

                        <p>The artist returned to Lviv in 1898, where he quickly immersed himself in the city's public
                            and artistic life. He played
                            a key role in founding the Society for the Development of Rus Art and engaged in literary
                            and artistic activities with
                            the Literary and Scientific Gazette. In 1899, he held his first solo exhibition, where all
                            38 paintings were sold within
                            a few weeks. During his time in Lviv, he developed a close relationship with Ivan Franko and
                            collaborated with the
                            Scientific Society named after Shevchenko (NTSh), producing various artworks and portraits
                            of notable cultural and
                            social figures from Trans-Dnieper Ukraine in Kyiv.</p>

                            <p> During his time in Kyiv, the artist formed close friendships with Mykola Murashko, Fotii
                                Krasytskyi, Ivan
                                Nechuy-Levytskyi, Mykhailo Starytskyi, and Pavlo Zhitetskyi. However, his closest bonds
                                were with Mykola Lysenko and
                                Lesya Ukrainka. Lesya Ukrainka and her mother, Olena Pchilka, played a significant role
                                in arranging his personal life.
                                At their invitation, he visited Poltava Oblast in the summer of 1900. There, at the
                                Drahomanov family estate in Gadyach,
                                he met Ariadna Drahomanova, the daughter of Mykhailo Drahomanov, who later became his
                                wife.</p>

                            <p>An impressionist lyricist and vivid colorist, Trush cherished working outdoors. He
                                described his outdoor sketches as a
                                respite and a glimpse into his artistic future, as well as the foundation for his
                                paintings. He organized his works into
                                landscape series—such as “Flowers,” “From the Life of Stumps,” “In the Arms of Snow,”
                                “Meadows and Fields,” and “Lonely
                                Pine”—often referring to them as “poems” and frequently revisiting his favorite themes
                                over the years. <br>
                                <br>
                                The artist traveled extensively, exploring Crimea, Egypt, various European countries,
                                and Palestine. These journeys,
                                influenced by his passion for plein air painting, are evident in his works. Ivan Trush
                                was active in exhibitions, both
                                collective and solo, showcasing his art across Ukrainian and Polish artistic circles.
                                His works captivated audiences in
                                cities such as London, Vienna, Sofia, Warsaw, Poznan, and Krakow. The largest collection
                                of his paintings is preserved
                                at the Lviv National Museum. (<a class="source-link"

                            one of Ukraine's most significant modernist painters, who, despite numerous challenges,
                            captured the history and

                        <p>Fedir Krychevsky was born into a large family, with his father working as a paramedic. He had
                            six siblings, including
                            his eldest brother, Vasyl Krychevsky, who would go on to become a renowned Ukrainian artist,
                            graphic designer, and
                            architect.
                            <br>

                            The family was not wealthy, so young Fedir Krychevsky received support for his artistic
                            studies from Count Vasyl Kapnist, a russian nobleman of
                            Ukrainian heritage and grandson of the poet Vasyl Kapnist. At the Count’s estate, Fedir had
                            access to a library and a
                            collection of paintings and drawings, including portraits of Cossack leaders. <br><br>

                            Konstantin Savitsky assisted the young artist in gaining admission to the Moscow School of
                            Painting, Sculpture, and
                            Architecture. After being introduced to Krychevsky's work by a friend, Savitsky recognized
                            his talent and offered him
                            shelter, preparing him for entry into the school.

                        <p>
                            Later, Krychevsky studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts, where his painting "The
                            Bride" (1910) earned him a trip
                            to Europe. During his travels, he visited France, Italy, and Germany, exploring numerous
                            world-renowned museums. In
                            Vienna, he had the chance to study with Gustav Klimt, an experience that significantly
                            influenced his artistic style.<br><br>
                            Krychevsky was required to present a “creative report” from his travels, which he did with
                            his painting “Wedding
                            Ceremony in Ukraine.” This piece, showcasing a distinctly Ukrainian theme, was displayed
                            alongside his Italian-themed
                            work, “Market in Rome,” at the Academy's senior exhibition. Critics observed that Krychevsky
                            showed a weakness to
                            love everything native.
                            Because of this “arrogance,” Krychevsky was "denied a pension.

                        <div class="pattern pattern-1"></div>
                        <p>Krychevsky had a special connection with the village of Shyshaky in the Poltava region. He
                            frequently visited the
                            village to paint from life and eventually purchased a house there, which he renovated based
                            on designs by his brother,
                            Vasyl Krychevsky. In this house, Krychevsky amassed a collection of folk art, including
                            embroidery, carpets, ceramics,
                            and iconography. The house later served as a branch of the academy, providing a location for
                            students' summer
                            internships.</p>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-1"></div>
                        <p>Upon returning from his travels, Krychevsky began teaching at the Kyiv Art School and
                            eventually became its director. In
                            1917, he was a key figure in establishing the Ukrainian Academy of Arts, the first higher
                            education institution of the
                            Ukrainian People's Republic. Krychevsky was appointed as its first rector, and the Academy
                            benefited from the
                            contributions of notable artists such as Heorhii Narbut, Oleksandr Murashko, Abram Manevych,
                            Mykhailo Boichuk, and
                            Mykola Burachek.</p>

                        <p>However, the situation changed drastically when the Bolsheviks took over Kyiv. In January
                            1918, they shot over FIVE
                            THOUSAND Ukrainian intellectuals within a matter of weeks. The following year, the position
                            of rector was transferred to
                            Narbut, but Krychevsky continued to lead the workshop focused on historical and domestic
                            genres, as well as etching and
                            carving.<br>
                            Professors and students went into hiding, and the academy was closed. Despite this, they
                            made efforts to keep the
                            educational process going, with students visiting professors' homes to continue their work.
                            In his memoirs, Mykhailo
                            Zhuk noted that the workshops of Oleksandr Murashko and Fedir Krychevsky were among the most
                            frequented. Krychevsky's
                            workshop, in particular, had a more diverse and democratic composition, including mostly
                            children of small artisans,
                            workers, and petty bourgeoisie. <br><br>
                            In June 1919, Professor Oleksandr Murashko was executed by Cheka agents near his home in
                            Lukianivka, being shot in the
                            back of the head. Official reports falsely claimed that he had been "robbed and beaten by
                            bandits."
                        </p>
                        <div class="pattern pattern-1"></div>
                        <p>In 1919, the Bolsheviks organized an artificial famine in Kyiv. Professors went to the
                            countryside to survive, and Fedir
                            Krychevsky went to Shyshaky, where he once bought a house. <br><br>

                            Krychevsky had no works reflecting Soviet themes, and Ukraine was starting to roll back its
                            Ukrainization policy. With
                            espionage and denunciations becoming common at the Kyiv Art Institute, the artist relocated
                            to Kharkiv to continue his
                            teaching.

                            In 1927, Krychevsky created the renowned triptych "Life," which stands as one of his most
                            celebrated works. This
                            painting is a vivid example of Ukrainian modernism, blending elements of Art Nouveau with
                            Ukrainian religious art. It is
                            noted for its flatness, local colors, and minimalistic background. <br><br>
                            The triptych was showcased at numerous exhibitions both in Ukraine and internationally. It
                            received significant acclaim
                            in Chicago and New York. The central panel, titled "Family," was particularly well-received
                            at the Venice International
                            Biennale, while the "Return" segment was featured at Soviet art exhibitions in Copenhagen
                            and Warsaw.
                            <br><br>
                            In 1939, Fedir and Vasyl Krychevsky were both awarded the title of Doctors of Arts. In May
                            1940, they became the first
                            in Ukraine to receive the title of Honored Artists of the Ukrainian SSR. Around this time,
                            Fedir Krychevsky embarked on
                            a creative journey through western Ukraine, visiting places like Kolomyia, Stanislav (now
                            Ivano-Frankivsk), Yavoriv,
                            Kryvyi Rih, Kosiv, Kuty, and Zhab'yem (now Verkhovyna).

                            These were likely the last peaceful years of his life, as the ensuing events in both world
                            and personal history brought
                            Krychevsky much hardship.

                        <p>At the onset of World War II, Krychevsky returned to Kyiv but avoided being forcibly
                            evacuated to Ufa. During the
                            occupation of the Ukrainian SSR by Wehrmacht troops, the elderly and ailing Krychevsky
                            remained in the occupied
                            territory, living either in Kyiv or Shyshaky. <br><br>

                            In 1943, Krychevsky fled to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), where his brother Vasyl
                            was already living. He found
                            work as a draftsman at a factory, but as the Red Army encircled the city, Krychevsky was
                            captured by a
                            counterintelligence unit of the People's Commissariat of Defense of the USSR on suspicion of
                            collaboration. He was
                            detained and tortured for a year. Upon his release, Krychevsky made his way back to Kyiv,
                            only to be arrested again.
                            However, he was eventually released due to his deteriorating health.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p class="last-p"> The artist lost his title of Honored Artist and discovered that he and his
                            wife were left without a home: their Kyiv
                            apartment had been destroyed in the bombings, and their dacha in Shyshaky had burned down.
                            For a while, the Krychevskys
                            stayed with friends in Kurenivka, but eventually, they were forcibly relocated by special
                            services from Kyiv to Irpin,
                            where they were kept under constant surveillance. <br><br>

                            Despite receiving no assistance and suffering from starvation, the artist persisted in his
                            work on the painting
                            "Blooming Ukraine." He also continued to lead the postgraduate program of monumental
                            painting and sculpture at the
                            Academy of Architecture. <br><br>
                            During this period, an incident occurred that best encapsulates Fedir Krychevsky's character
                            and has since become one of
                            the most well-known legends about him. Nikita Khrushchev offered to grant the artist a
                            pardon if he would paint a
                            portrait of the "father of nations," Joseph Stalin. Krychevsky then shared with his
                            students: <br>

                            “You see, my rank does not allow me to paint any temporary favorites, scoundrels, and
                            bastards.” <br><br>

                            Fedir Krychevskyi remained steadfast in his principles until the end, refusing to
                            collaborate with the regime. According
                            to records and accounts, the artist passed away from starvation on July 30, 1947, while at
                            his easel.(

                        <p class="main-info">Oleksandr Murashko was among the first to recognize the dawn of a new era
                            in Ukrainian art and played an active role in
                            the cultural life of the nation. His dedicated civic engagement and tireless efforts for
                            Ukraine’s revival ultimately
                            led to his martyrdom. As a master painter, mentor, and public figure, Murashko is remembered
                            in history for his profound
                            contributions to the arts. (<a class="source-link"

                        <p>
                            Oleksandr Murashko was born out of wedlock to Maria Krachkovska, who entrusted him to his
                            grandmother's care. The young
                            boy spent his early years in the Chernihiv region under his grandmother’s loving
                            supervision. When he was eight, his
                            mother remarried and brought him to Chernihiv. His stepfather, also named Oleksandr
                            Murashko, was a renowned icon
                            painter, iconostasis maker, and wood carver. Additionally, his uncle, Mykola Murashko,
                            founded a drawing school in Kyiv
                            where notable artists such as M. Pymonenko, S. Kostenko, I. Izhakevych, M. Zhuk, and V.
                            Serov developed their painting
                            skills. <br><br>
                            The stepfather envisioned the boy becoming an icon painter, and under his guidance, the boy
                            started painting icons and
                            actively contributed to the family business. In the late 1880s, Murashko had the chance to
                            observe the work of Viktor
                            Vasnetsov, Mikhail Nesterov, and Mikhail Vrubel, who were involved in decorating St.
                            Volodymyr Cathedral. Despite this,
                            Sashko aspired to be a painter himself and spent some time balancing visits to his
                            godmother’s workshop with lessons at
                            Mykola Murashko's drawing school. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p> The stepfather did not support the young Murashko's desire to study at the St. Petersburg
                            Academy of Arts, leading to a
                            conflict that ultimately forced Oleksandr Murashko to leave home. However, Mykola Murashko
                            and his close associates
                            managed to mediate between the stepfather and the young artist. As a result, Murashko was
                            allowed to enroll first in a
                            drawing school and then in the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts (1896-1901). While in St.
                            Petersburg, he honed his skills
                            under Ilya Repin. Even during his studies, Murashko's portraits gained recognition from
                            critics, collectors, and
                            instructors. He spent his vacations in Ukraine, drawing inspiration from its landscapes and
                            the daily lives of its
                            people. In 1900, he created his graduation piece, "The Funeral of Koshovyi," depicting the
                            funeral of Ivan Sirko, a
                            17th-century Zaporizhian Cossack leader. This work was highly acclaimed and earned Murashko
                            a Major Gold Medal, the
                            title of free artist, and a pension for a European trip.

                        <p>In 1901, Murashko arrived in Paris, where he visited renowned museums and explored the works
                            of classical masters.
                            During this time, he experienced the strong influence of modernist trends in painting.
                            Although France had begun to move
                            away from Impressionism and was embracing modernist aesthetics, Murashko remained true to
                            his personal artistic
                            philosophy. The Impressionists' stylistic techniques and their innovative use of color
                            deeply impressed him. Following
                            his time in Paris, Murashko's style entered its final phase of development. <br><br>
                            After Paris, Murashko traveled to Munich, where he studied at Anton Ažbe's school, met
                            renowned modernist artists, and
                            continued to refine his personal style. His European journey concluded with his return home
                            in 1903. <br><br>
                            Subsequently, Murashko’s works were showcased at numerous exhibitions across Europe,
                            including in Rome, Venice,
                            Amsterdam, Berlin, Düsseldorf, and Vienna. In 1911, he was honored with election to the
                            Munich Secession.</p>

                            <p>In 1909, Murashko relocated to Kyiv and married Marharyta Kruger, the daughter of a
                                notary. Marharyta, an educated and
                                beautiful woman, became not only his wife but also his model and assistant. Although
                                they did not have children of their own, but the couple raised their adopted daughter
                                Kateryna. Later that year, Murashko began teaching at the Kyiv Art School.
                                His attempts to implement European teaching methods were met with resistance from other
                                faculty members, leading him to
                                open his own studio in 1913. While he frequently received commissions for portraits, he
                                found less satisfaction in these
                                works compared to those he created independently. The outbreak of the First World War
                                contributed to the destabilization
                                and eventual collapse of the Russian Empire, but Murashko continued his teaching and
                                increasingly focused on painting
                                portraits of his family and friends. </p>

                        <p class="last-p"> In 1917, Murashko played an active role in the establishment of the Academy
                            of Arts, the first higher art educational
                            institution in Ukraine. However, the educational process was frequently disrupted due to
                            ongoing shortages of essential
                            supplies like paints, canvases, and other materials. The tense atmosphere in Kyiv,
                            exacerbated by the exhausting war
                            across Europe, further complicated matters. The demands of his official duties left Murashko
                            with little time for his
                            creative work.

                            A significant shift in Murashko's life occurred in early 1919 when the Bolsheviks occupied
                            Kyiv, the capital of the
                            fledgling Ukrainian republic. As a man of considerable means, Murashko was labeled a "kulak"
                            by the new regime, forcing
                            him to pay hefty contributions. Additionally, there were attempts to send him to forced
                            labor, further straining his
                            circumstances.
                            <br><br>
                            As a prominent figure within the Ukrainian creative intelligentsia, Murashko posed a threat
                            to the Bolsheviks' plans for
                            building a Soviet state. It wasn't just about his financial standing or love for Ukraine—the
                            new regime sought
                            individuals with a completely reformed worldview, ready to obey any order without question.
                            In such an environment, the
                            fate of leading Ukrainian cultural figures seemed predetermined. On June 14, 1919, Murashko
                            was attacked by unknown
                            assailants while walking with his wife. He was taken away under the pretense of a document
                            check, but his body was later
                            discovered, having been shot in the back of the head. No investigation was conducted, but
                            the circumstances align with
                            the Soviet government's tactics, which would go on to claim millions of Ukrainian lives in
                            the years that followed. Some
                            art historians argue that Murashko was the first victim of the Ukrainian "Executed
                            Renaissance." (<a class="source-link"
