              Taras Shevchenko was the leading Ukrainian poet, prose writer, painter, and playwright of the 19th
              century. A central
              figure in the Ukrainian national revival, Shevchenko was a man of exceptional talent, devoting his entire
              life and
              creative work to the Ukrainian people.(

              <p class="artist-first-p">
                Taras Shevchenko was born into a family of serfs. His father became a traveling merchant (chumak),
                transporting the
                landlord's wheat to cities like Odesa and Kyiv. As Taras grew older, his father took him along on these
                journeys, one of
                which Shevchenko later recounted in his story "The Hireling" ("Naymychka"). <br>
                When he was just 9 years old, Taras lost his mother. His father, now alone with the young children,
                remarried a widow named
                Oksana Tereshchenko, who already had three children of her own. By the age of eleven, Taras was an
                orphan, left to live
                with his stepmother. <br>
                “Who had ever seen even from afar a stepmother and the so-called stepbrothers and stepsisters, that
                means one saw hell
                in the triumph of its disgusting.” <br><br>
                While his mother was still alive, Shevchenko was sent to study with the rural deacon (precentor) Paul
                Ruban (Sovhyr). He
                quickly mastered reading and writing and began drawing, revealing a significant talent for art. Driven
                by an
                unquenchable desire to improve his drawing skills, Taras traveled from one village to another in search
                of a skilled
                painting teacher.
              </p>

            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>At the age of 14, Taras Shevchenko became a houseboy for his owner, Pavlo Engelhardt. In 1829, Engelhardt
              and his wife
              took Shevchenko with them to Wilno (Vilnius), where he began learning Polish language and literature and
              secretly copied
              some paintings. While in Wilno, Shevchenko was sent to study painting in the studio of Jan Rustem.
              <br><br>
              When the Polish uprising for national liberation from Russia broke out in November 1830, Engelhardt
              relocated to St.
              Petersburg with all their servants. <br>
              Recognizing Shevchenko's artistic talent, Engelhardt arranged for him to apprentice with the painter V.
              Shiriaev for
              four years. During this time, Shevchenko worked on projects like painting the Bolshoi Theatre as an
              apprentice
              draftsman. In St. Petersburg, he met the Ukrainian artist Ivan Soshenko, who introduced him to other
              compatriots,
              including Yevhen Hrebinka and Vasyl Hryhorovych, as well as the Russian painter A. Venetsianov. These
              connections
              eventually led to his introduction to the renowned painter and professor Karl Briullov, who donated a
              portrait of the
              Russian poet Vasilii Zhukovsky for a lottery. The proceeds from this lottery were used to buy Shevchenko's
              freedom
              on May 5, 1838.

            <p>That same year, Shevchenko's drawings were endorsed by the Association for the Encouragement of Artists,
              securing his
              admission to the Imperial Academy of Arts as an external student. He then worked in the studio of Karl

              As Shevchenko's artistic skills advanced, he made remarkable strides in painting. He became an
              accomplished portrait
              artist and a skilled watercolorist, earning three silver medals from the Academy for his work. In 1840, he
              was awarded
              for his painting "The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog," and in 1841 for "A Gypsy Fortune Teller." As his
              artistic skills flourished, Shevchenko made notable strides in painting. He became a skilled portrait
              artist and
              excelled in watercolor. For his academic achievements, he was awarded three silver medals by the Academy:
              in 1840 for
              "The Beggar Boy Giving Bread to a Dog," in 1841 for "A Gypsy Fortune Teller," and the first silver medal
              in 1839,
              although the painting for which he received it did not arrive in time.

              Unlike other Academy students, his works often shows ordinary people—such as serf girls, children, and
              gypsy
              women—aiming to draw attention to their plight and suffering. <br><br>
              At Yevhen Hrebinka’s library, Shevchenko explored collections of Ukrainian folklore and the works of I.
              Kotlyarevsky, H.
              Kvitka-Osnovyanenko, and various Romantic poets, alongside many russian, East European, and global
              authors.

              Shevchenko started writing poetry even before his release from serfdom. In 1840, his first poetry
              collection, "Kobzar,"
              was published.<br>
              “Author of the book “Kobzar” brought to the literature unique colors and tones, a whole world of images
              and ideas, that
              were inherent in the way of life and artistic thinking of his nation. Shevchenko’s poetry had absorbed the
              life-giving
              purity of ukrainian folklore, power, riches and expressiveness of the Ukrainian language.”
              Leonid Novychenko. <br>
              In 1841, Shevchenko published the epic poem "Haidamaky" and the ballad "Hamaliia" in 1844. He also
              ventured into
              playwriting, with a fragment of the tragedy "Mykyta Haidai" appearing in 1842 and the complete drama
              "Nazar Stodolya"
              finished in 1843.

              During this period, Shevchenko's poetry reflected a profound national consciousness that characterized his
              work
              throughout his life. He expressed his deep connection to his nation, stating, “Body and soul, I am the son
              and brother
              of our unfortunate nation.”

              As Shevchenko's criticism of social and national oppression intensified, tsarist censors removed many
              passages from his
              poetry and obstructed the publication of his works. Despite these challenges, no critic could dispute
              Shevchenko’s
              brilliance.

              <p>While living in Saint Petersburg, Shevchenko made three trips to Ukraine in 1843, 1845, and 1846, which
                had a profound
                effect on him. He visited various villages and towns, creating numerous sketches. <br> <br> During these
                visits, he also saw his enserfed siblings and other relatives, met notable Ukrainian writers and
                intellectuals like Yevhen Hrebinka, Panteleimon Kulish, and Mykhailo Maksymovych, and developed a
                friendship with the
                princely Repnin family, particularly Varvara Repnina. <br><br> Disturbed by the tsarist oppression and
                devastation he witnessed in Ukraine, Shevchenko decided to document the
                historical ruins and cultural landmarks of his homeland in an album of etchings titled Zhivopisnaia
                Ukraina (Picturesque
                Ukraine, 1844). <br> <br> The harsh conditions faced by workers and peasants in Ukraine inspired new
                themes in his poetry, and the works of Polish
                poet Adam Mickiewicz, especially his political satire, also influenced Shevchenko.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>
              After finishing his studies at the Academy of Arts in 1845, Shevchenko was granted permission to travel to
              Ukraine. He
              arrived there at the end of March. By December of that year, the renowned poet wrote his famous poem
              "Testament
              (Zapovit)," in which he fervently urged the nation to rise up in armed rebellion. <br>
              “Oh bury me, then rise ye up And break your heavy chains And water with the tyrants' blood The freedom you
              have gained.”
              (Translated by John Weir). <br><br>
              Shevchenko joined the Kyiv Archeographic Commission and traveled extensively throughout Russian-occupied
              Ukraine in
              1845, where he sketched historical and architectural sites and gathered folklore and ethnographic
              materials. During his
              time in Ukraine in 1844 and 1845, he wrote some of his most satirical and politically charged narrative
              poems,
              including "Son" (A Dream), "Sova" (The Owl), "Kholodnyi Iar," "Ieretyk"/"Ivan Hus" (The Heretic/Jan Hus),
              "Slipyi" (The
              Blind Man), "Velykyi l'okh" (The Great Vault), and "Kavkaz" (The Caucasus). He compiled these works, along
              with other
              poems from 1843–45, into a collection he named "Try lita" (Three Years). <br><br>
              In May 1846, Taras Shevchenko met Mykola Kostomarov, a renowned historian and one of the founders of The
              Brotherhood of
              Saints Cyril and Methodius. Starting in December, Shevchenko began attending the Brotherhood's meetings,
              where he shared
              his revolutionary poetry with the members.

              The Brotherhood comprised students and professors from the universities of Kyiv and Kharkiv. Besides
              Kostomarov and
              Shevchenko, other prominent members included Georgi Andruzky, Vasyl Bilozersky, Mykola Gulak, and
              Panteleimon Kulish. <br> <br>

              Like the other members of the Brotherhood, Shevchenko was arrested on April 5, 1847. The next day, he was
              transported to
              St. Petersburg, where he was imprisoned. During his time in custody, he wrote the poetry cycle "In the
              Dungeon."
              Among all the Brotherhood members investigated, Shevchenko received the harshest punishment due to his
              anti-tsarist
              satirical poems in "Try lita." He was exiled as a private to a military unit in Orenburg. Tsar Nicholas I,
              in affirming
              the sentence, decreed that Shevchenko be placed "under the strictest surveillance, with a prohibition on
              writing and
              painting." </p>

              In Prison: VIII A Spring Evening <br>

              On June 8, 1847, Shevchenko was assigned to Orenburg, where he served until he was transferred to the more
              remote fort
              at Orsk. From the outset, he defied the tsar's orders by transcribing "In the Dungeon" into a small,
              secret book that he
              concealed in his boot. In 1848, he participated as an artist in the Aral Sea Survey expedition. In 1850,
              Shevchenko was
              arrested for breaching the tsar's restrictions. Forewarned by friends, he managed to pass his notebooks to
              them and
              destroy some letters before his arrest. After being interrogated in Orsk, he was sent to a distant fort in
              Novopetrovsk
              (now Fort Shevchenko in Kazakhstan). There, he faced even stricter discipline and surveillance. It was not
              until 1857,
              through the efforts of his supporters, that he was finally released from exile.

              </p>
            </div>
            <p>While waiting for permission to return, Shevchenko started a diary that became a crucial record of his
              political
              beliefs. On August 2, 1857, he departed from the fort at Novopetrovsk after being granted permission to
              travel to St.
              Petersburg. However, upon reaching Nizhniy Novgorod, he discovered that he was prohibited from traveling
              to Moscow or
              St. Petersburg, with the threat of being sent back to Orenburg if he did so. <br><br>
              During the winter of 1857-58 in Nizhniy, Shevchenko was highly productive. He created numerous paintings,
              especially
              portraits, edited and transcribed his poems from his exile into a collection called Bilsha knyzhka (The
              Larger Book),
              and composed new poetry. Once he was granted permission to reside in the capital, he moved to St.
              Petersburg. Despite
              this, Shevchenko remained under police surveillance until his death. In St. Petersburg, he focused
              extensively on
              engraving, establishing himself as a significant innovator in the field. </p>

            <p> In 1859, Shevchenko was permitted to visit his relatives and friends in Ukraine. He planned to purchase
              land near the
              village of Pekariv, build a house, and settle there. However, in July, he was arrested on charges of
              blasphemy but was
              later released and instructed to return to St. Petersburg, arriving on September 7. Despite his enduring
              wish to settle
              in Ukraine, he was never allowed to fulfill this dream.

            <p>
              Despite the physical weakness from ten years of exile, Shevchenko's creative vitality remained unbounded.
              In his final
              years, his work captured the people's longing for freedom and happiness. Shevchenko recognized that
              peasants would not
              achieve liberation through the tsar's benevolence or reforms, but through active struggle. <br><br>
              On September 2, 1860, the Council of the Academy of Arts granted Shevchenko the title, Academician of
              Engraving. </p>

            <p> In the final years of his life, Taras Shevchenko focused on creating new poetry, paintings, and
              engravings, while also
              revising his earlier works. However, the hardships of his exile took a toll, and his last illness became
              overwhelming. <br><br>

              Taras Shevchenko passed away in Saint Petersburg on March 10 (February 26 by the old calendar), 1861.
              Initially interred
              at the Smolensk Cemetery in Saint Petersburg, his remains were later moved to fulfill his wish expressed
              in his poem
              “Testament” (“Zapovit”). They were reburied on Chernecha Hora (Monk’s Mountain) near Kaniv, Ukraine. Since
              then, his
              grave has become a revered site, visited by millions of Ukrainians, and is now part of the Kaniv
              Museum-Preserve,
              established in 1925. <br><br>
              Shevchenko has had a unique place in Ukrainian cultural history and in world literature. Through his
              writings he laid
              the foundations for the creation of a fully functional modern Ukrainian literature. His writings
              established the groundwork for the development of contemporary Ukrainian literature. His poetry
              significantly advanced Ukrainian national consciousness, and his impact continues to be felt across many
              aspects of
              Ukrainian intellectual, literary, and national life. (

              When I am dead, bury me <br>
              In my beloved Ukraine,<br>
              My tomb upon a grave mound high<br>
              Amid the spreading plain,<br>
              So that the fields, the boundless steppes,<br>
              The Dnieper's plunging shore<br>
              My eyes could see, my ears could hear<br>
              The mighty river roar.<br><br>

              When from Ukraine the Dnieper bears<br>
              Into the deep blue sea<br>
              The blood of foes ... then will I leave<br>
              These hills and fertile fields <br>
              I'll leave them all and fly away<br>
              To the abode of God,<br>
              And then I'll pray .... But till that day<br>
              I nothing know of God.<br><br>

              Oh bury me, then rise ye up<br>
              And break your heavy chains<br>
              And water with the tyrants' blood<br>
              The freedom you have gained.<br>
              And in the great new family,<br>
              The family of the free,<br>
              With softly spoken, kindly word<br>
              Remember also me.<br><br>

              A Ukrainian poetess, writer, translator, dramatist and critic who was the foremost woman writer in
              Ukrainian literature and
              a leading figure in its modernist movement.She was referred to as a daughter of Prometheus due to her
              liberating poetic style, characterized by optimism, as well
              as the strength of her spirit and the romantic nature of her remarkable personality.

              Lesia Ukrainka, the pen name of the renowned Ukrainian writer Larysa Kosach, translates to "Ukrainian
              woman." At the
              time of her literary debut at age 13, there was no Ukrainian state, and the Ukrainian territories were
              split between the
              Austro-Hungarian and russian empires. In the russian Empire, where Ukrainka lived, writing in Ukrainian
              was particularly
              risky. Ukrainian literature faced strict censorship in St. Petersburg, and translations of global
              literature into
              Ukrainian were forbidden to maintain the imperial ideology that viewed the Ukrainian language as a mere
              regional dialect
              unfit for "high culture." By choosing the pen name ‘Ukrainka’ at a young age, Larysa Kosach not only
              embraced her
              Ukrainian heritage but also redefined what it meant to be a Ukrainian woman of her era.</p>

              <p class="img-description">Lesia and Mykhailo Kosachi</p>
            </div>
            <p> Lesia Ukrainka was born to a lawyer named Petro Kosach and Olena Pchilka, a prominent Ukrainian writer
              and public
              figure. She was the second of the Kosachs' six children. Both of her parents came from gentry backgrounds:
              Petro Kosach
              was a wealthy Ukrainian Cossack nobleman with his own coat of arms who gained russian noble status
              following the
              dissolution of the Hetmanate. Olena Pchilka, on the other hand, hailed from the Drahomanov family, which
              was associated
              with the Cossack officer class. <br><br>
              Lesia spent the first six months of her life with her father. After Lesia’s birth, her mother, Olha
              Kosach, developed
              anemia and traveled to Europe for treatment. During this time, Petro Kosach took a leave from his duties
              to care for his
              oldest son, Mykhailo, and baby Lesia, effectively saving her life. <br><br>
              Lesia received most of her education at home. Initially, she followed her mother’s curriculum, with Olena
              Pchilka
              teaching her children in Ukrainian up to the 5th grade to prevent the russian school system from
              influencing them.
              Later, private tutors were brought in to teach Lesia at home, as she was bedridden for an extended period
              due to bone
              tuberculosis, which was diagnosed when she was ten years old. <br>
              Despite her health challenges, Lesya Ukrainka became proficient in numerous languages, including French
              (which she spoke
              more fluently than russian), German, English, Italian, Polish, Bulgarian, Latin, and Greek. <br>
              Lesya had a deep passion for music and dedicated herself to learning the piano, believing she might have
              excelled as a
              musician even more than as a poet. Although her illness prevented her from pursuing a musical career,
              music continued to
              be a source of joy, support, and inspiration throughout her life.

              </div>
              <p>At the age of nine, Lesya wrote her first poem, "Hope," and by thirteen, her work was published in the
                Lviv magazine
                "Zorya." Her mother supported her literary pursuits by offering advice and helping with the distribution
                of her poems.
                The pseudonym "Lesya Ukrainka" was inspired by her respected uncle, Mykhailo Drahomanov, a prominent
                scholar, publicist,
                literary critic, folklorist, and public figure who used the pen name "Ukrainian." The name "Lesya" was a
                term of
                endearment used within her family, leading to the creation of the pseudonym "Lesya Ukrainka."
                <br><br>
                In 1893, Lesya Ukrainka's debut poetry collection, "On the Wings of Songs," was published in Lviv. Over
                her career, she
                wrote approximately 270 poems, in addition to her narrative poetry, dramatic works, and translations.
                <br><br>
                Lesya Ukrainka was deeply involved in translation work. Through her efforts, Ukrainian translations were
                made of ancient
                Egyptian lyrics, the Rig Veda from ancient India, works by Homer, Heinrich Heine, as well as writings by
                Victor Hugo,
                William Shakespeare, Dante, and other notable authors.

              <p>Lesia Ukrainka, together with Olena Pchilka, Natalia Kobrynska, Olha Kobylianska, and other writers,
                played a pivotal
                role in advancing the feminist movement in Ukrainian literature. Her female characters are depicted as
                independent,
                self-reliant, and proud, challenging societal norms of the time, particularly within the russian Empire.
                She contributed
                to the women's almanac "The First Wreath," which was established in 1887 by Natalia Kobrynska and Olena
                Pchilka.
                Ukrainka was a strong advocate for women's emancipation and supported movements that sought to expand
                opportunities for
                women’s self-fulfillment. <br><br>

                Between 1895 and 1897, Lesia Ukrainka was actively involved in the politically engaged Literary and
                Artistic Society of
                Kyiv, although she eventually found herself more suited to leading her own literary circle. She and her
                brother Mykhaylo
                co-founded a literary group named Pleiada, inspired by the French Pléiade, a reference to the
                constellation of the Seven
                Sisters. This group, which operated from 1888 to 1893, brought together a cohort of writers focused on
                preserving the
                Ukrainian language against russian imperialism. They met secretly at each other's homes, working on
                translating
                international classics into Ukrainian and compiling poetry and prose collections, despite the challenges
                posed by
                russian censorship. The group's efforts persisted despite the restrictive laws of the time.</p>

                Thoughts away, you heavy clouds of autumn! <br>
                For now springtime comes, agleam with gold!<br>
                Shall thus in grief and wailing for ill-fortune<br>
                All the tale of my young years be told?<br><br>

                No, I want to smile through tears and weeping.,<br>
                Sing my songs where evil holds its sway,<br>
                Hopeless, a steadfast hope forever keeping,<br>
                I want to live! You thoughts of grief, away!<br><br>

                On poor sad fallow land unused to tilling<br>
                I'll sow blossoms, brilliant in hue,<br>
                I'll sow blossoms where the frost lies, chilling,<br>
                I'll pour bitter tears on them as due.<br>

                And those burning tears shall melt, dissolving<br>
                All that mighty crust of ice away.<br>
                Maybe blossoms will come up, unfolding<br>
                Singing springtime too for me, some day.<br><br>

                Up the flinty steep and craggy mountain<br>
                A weighty ponderous boulder I shall raise,<br>
                And bearing this dread burden, a resounding<br>
                Song I'll sing, a song of joyous praise.<br><br>

                In the long dark ever-viewless night-time<br>
                Not one instant shall I close my eyes,<br>
                I'll seek ever for the star to guide me,<br>
                She that reigns bright mistress of dark skies.<br><br>

                Yes, I'll smile, indeed, through tears and weeping<br>
                Sing my songs where evil holds its sway,<br>
                Hopeless, a steadfast hope forever keeping,<br>

              <p>The Kosach family was part of the aristocracy but actively embraced their Ukrainian identity. They
                spoke Ukrainian from
                a young age and dressed in traditional folk costumes. By the early 20th century, during the conservative
                backlash
                following the assassination of Alexander II, only three families in Kyiv maintained such a strong
                Ukrainian presence:
                the Lysenko, Staritsky, and Kosach families. In 1903, during the unveiling of a monument to Kotliarevsky
                in Poltava,
                Olena Pchilka, Lesia Ukrainka's mother, defied the ban on speaking Ukrainian and addressed the audience
                in their native
                language.

                On the night of January 17-18, 1907, the police raided the Kosach family's apartment in Kyiv, seizing
                121 socialist
                pamphlets, mostly belonging to Lesia Ukrainka's brother. Lesia and her sister Olha were detained
                overnight at the police
                station. Following this incident, Lesia Ukrainka was placed under secret police surveillance, requiring
                her to obtain
                police permission even for trips to Kolodiazhne. Her works were frequently censored, leading her to
                publish much of her
                writing abroad, in regions like Galicia and Bukovyna, which were part of Austria-Hungary at the time.

              <p class="last-p">
                Due to her illness, which required ongoing treatment, Lesia Ukrainka traveled extensively throughout
                Europe, spending
                significant time in Italy, Egypt, and Crimea, specifically Yalta. She had a deep appreciation for
                theatre and opera,
                having visited nearly all of the leading European theaters. She was knowledgeable about European art,
                held memberships
                in prestigious libraries across various locations, and kept abreast of the latest literary and
                scientific developments.
                Ukrainka actively promoted European influences in Ukrainian culture and played a key role in introducing
                modernist ideas
                to Ukrainian literature. <br>
                Her entire life was a fight: battling illness, challenging societal norms, asserting her right to be
                Ukrainian,
                expressing her own views, living independently, and remaining self-reliant. Ivan Franko described Lesia
                Ukrainka as "the
                only man in our literature." <br><br>

                In her final years, she lived in Egypt and several cities in Georgia due to her husband, Klyment
                Kvitka's work
                assignments. Lesia Ukrainka passed away on August 1, 1913, in the Georgian village of Surami, worn out
                by illness and
                kidney failure. She was interred in Kyiv's Baikove Cemetery, close to her father and brother Mykhailo.
                Six women carried
                her coffin to the cemetery. (

              Ivan Franko was born into the family of a village blacksmith. His father died when Ivan Franko was only
              about eleven years old. It was about his father's death in 1871. Franko wrote
              his first poem. His stepfather treated his stepson well and allowed him to continue his studies. But soon
              the young
              gymnasium student's mother died, whom he loved very much and dedicated his memories to her in the poem
              "Song and Labour"
              (1883) and in the poem "Thoughts on the Verge" (1881). <br>

              Even after Ivan Franko's mother's death, his stepfather, who remarried, did not change his attitude
              towards his stepson
              and helped him continue his studies. On 26 July 1875, Ivan Franko graduated from Drohobych Gymnasium and
              received his
              matriculation certificate. <br><br>

              From childhood, Taras Shevchenko's "Kobzar" became his favourite book. While at the gymnasium, Franko
              became deeply
              interested in and acquainted with Polish, German, French, and Latin classics. <br><br>
              In the summer of 1874, I. Franko travelled alone for the first time to Subcarpathia (Lolyn, Turya,
              Volosenky, etc.) and
              made folklore notes, and in the autumn of 1875 he entered the Faculty of Philosophy at Lviv University.

                While still a gymnasium student, he published his first literary works in the student university
                magazine in Lviv,
                "Druh". After joining the student "Academic Club", Franko became an active worker and author of its
                organ "Druh": he
                published poetry, translations, his first major novel "Petriy and Dovbushchuks", with a special fervour
                he got
                acquainted with russian revolutionary democratic literature, published in "Druh" (1877) a translation of
                Chernyshevsky's novel "What to do?", translates Pushkin's poems "The Crow Flies to
                the Crow" and "The Mermaid", which were included in his first collection of poems "Ballads and Stories"
                (1876). <br><br>
                Franko's political and publishing efforts, along with his correspondence with Mykhailo Drahomanov,
                caught the attention
                of the police. In 1877, he was arrested alongside Mykhailo Pavlyk, Ostap Terletsky, and others for
                disseminating
                socialist propaganda. After eight months in prison, Franko resumed his political activities with
                increased
                determination, vigorously opposing the Austrian monarchy and its representatives of social and national
                oppression. <br>
                He played a key role in organizing workers' groups in Lviv and contributed articles to the Polish
                newspaper "Praca."
                Franko studied the works of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, translating parts of "Capital" and sections
                from
                "Anti-Dühring" for publication as separate pamphlets, and wrote introductions for these publications. In
                1878, he
                co-founded the magazine "Hromads'kyi druh" with Pavlyk, where he published his poems "To Comrades from
                Prison," his
                essay "Patriotic Impulses," and the beginning of his novel "Boa constrictor." Although this magazine was
                soon seized by
                the authorities, it was later revived under the names "Dzvin" and "Molot." In these publications, Franko
                featured his
                well-known programmatic poem "The Stone-hewers" and the short story "My Meeting with Oleksa." In 1880,
                he was arrested
                again for allegedly inciting peasants against the authorities. After serving a three-month sentence, he
                was released but
                placed under police surveillance and forced to halt his university studies.

            <p>In the early stages of his career, Franko wrote political poems such as "The Stone-hewers" (1878), "The
              Eternal
              Revolutionary" (1880), and "This Is Not the Time..." (1880), which became patriotic anthems and shaped the
              views of an
              entire generation. He also wrote novels like "Boa Constrictor" (1878), "Boryslav Is Laughing" (1881), and
              "Zakhar
              Berkut" (1883), along with a number of literary and journalistic articles. In 1881, Franko co-founded the
              monthly
              magazine "Svit," and after its closure in 1882, he went on to edit the journal "Zoria" in Lviv and the
              newspaper "Dilo"
              (1883–1885). </p>

            <p> Leaving behind the populists who were wary of his radical socialist and revolutionary ideas, Franko
              attempted to
              establish an independent journal. To secure support, he made two trips to Kyiv in 1885 and 1886. In May
              1886, he married
              Olha Khoruzhynska in Kyiv, and the couple had four children. When his journal failed to materialize,
              Franko joined the
              staff of the Polish newspaper "Kurjer Lwowski." Reflecting on the decade (1887–1897) he spent working for
              the Polish
              press (including "Przyjaciel ludu") and the German press ("Die Zeit"), Franko remarked that he was
              essentially "doing
              hired labor for the neighbors." </p>

            <p> Franko's connections with his compatriots from Dnieper Ukraine led to his third arrest in 1889. The
              following year, with
              Mykhailo Drahomanov’s support, he co-founded the Ruthenian-Ukrainian Radical Party and drafted its
              program. Alongside
              Mykhailo Pavlyk, he published the party's journals Narod (1890–1895) and Khliborob (1891–1895) in Lviv and
              Kolomyia.
              Despite running for a seat in the Austrian Parliament and the Galician Diet in 1895, 1897, and 1898,
              Franko lost the
              elections due to administrative manipulations and opposition provocations. In 1899, amid a crisis in the
              Radical Party,
              Franko helped establish the National Democratic Party with the populists, remaining active in it until
              1904 when he
              withdrew from political life. Although he had long collaborated with M. Drahomanov, whom he respected as a
              'European
              political leader,' their views eventually diverged on socialism and national issues. Franko criticized
              Drahomanov for
              aligning Ukraine's future with russia in his work "The Sociopolitical Views of M. Drahomanov" (1906).</p>

              </div>
              <p>In addition to his political and literary pursuits, Franko continued his academic studies. He first
                attended Chernivtsi
                University in 1891, where he worked on a dissertation about Ivan Vyshensky. He then went to Vienna
                University, where on
                July 1, 1893, he defended a doctoral thesis on the spiritual romance "Barlaam and Josaphat" under the
                guidance of the
                distinguished Slavist Vatroslav Jagić. In 1894, Franko was appointed as a lecturer in Ukrainian
                literature at Lviv
                University but was unable to secure the chair in Ukrainian literature due to opposition from Vicegerent
                Kazimierz Badeni
                and conservative Galician circles. From 1894 to 1897, he and his wife published the journal "Zhytie i
                slovo," where many
                of his articles appeared, including "Socialism and Social Democracy" (1898), which critically examined
                Ukrainian Social
                Democracy and the socialism of Marx and Engels. In the introduction to his 1898 poetry collection "My
                Emerald," Franko
                continued his critique of Marxism, describing it as a "religion founded on dogmas of hatred and class
                struggle." <br><br>
                When Mykhailo Hrushevsky arrived in Lviv in 1894, Franko began a close association with the Shevchenko
                Scientific
                Society. By 1899, he had become a full member of the society and was made an honorary member in 1904.
                Much of his
                scholarly work, including historical and literary notes and reviews, was published in the "Zapysky
                Naukovoho Tovarystva
                im. Shevchenka" (Records of the Shevchenko Scientific Society). Franko was active in the Ethnographic
                Commission of the
                Shevchenko Scientific Society and led the Philological Section from 1898 to 1908. With Franko and
                Hrushevsky's efforts,
                the Shevchenko Scientific Society evolved into a prominent scholarly institution similar to an academy
                of sciences
                before World War I.

                In 1897, Franko’s article in "Die Zeit," where he criticized Adam Mickiewicz as a "poet of treason"
                ("Der Dichter des
                Verrates"), marked the end of his journalism career. Following this, Franko focused entirely on editing
                the
                "Literaturno-naukovyi vistnyk" (Literary-Scientific Herald) from 1898 to 1906, working alongside
                Hrushevsky and
                Volodymyr Hnatiuk, though Franko was the primary editor. In 1898, the Ukrainian community honored the
                25th anniversary
                of Franko's career as a writer.

            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>
              Franko was known for his love of vyshyvanka (embroidered shirt in Ukrainian national costumes), which he
              wore both on weekdays and holidays, thus becoming the pioneer of a
              new fashion, as he combined a shirt with Ukrainian ornaments with a European suit. Ironically, Franko,
              who loved wearing
              vyshyvankas throughout his life, was buried in someone else's shirt, because at the time there was "not
              a single decent
              one" at hand.

            <p>Despite his seriousness as a writer, Franko was very fond of riding a bicycle (although he never bought
              one), picking
              mushrooms, and going fishing. The writer did not use a fishing rod because he preferred nets that he
              wove with his own
              hands. Moreover, he could catch fish even with his bare hands.

              </div>
              <p class="last-p">In 1908 Franko's health began to decline rapidly. Yet, he continued to work to the end
                of his life. In this last period he wrote "Outline of the History of
                Ukrainian-Ruthenian Literature to 1890" (1910) and "Studies of Ukrainian Folk
                Songs" (1913) and did numerous translations of ancient poetry. In 1913 all Ukraine celebrated the 40th
                anniversary of his
                literary work. <br><br>
                Franko's death was marked by a conflict with the clergy. Olha Rozdolska wrote in her memoirs: "The
                community wanted to
                give the deceased a ceremonial funeral with a large number of priests. But it quickly turned out that
                this was out of
                the question, because the deceased was a "clear enemy of the clergy." Atheism was the main pillar of
                his worldview. When
                Franko was dying, Father Theodosius Halushchynsky persuaded him to make peace with the Lord and the
                church, but he
                received a response: "What would the young people, whom I have taught all my life not to believe in
                God, say?". <br><br>
                With his diverse talents, vast knowledge, and remarkable work ethic, Franko made significant
                contributions to various
                facets of Ukrainian culture. He was a pioneering realist in Ukrainian literature and the foremost poet
                of the
                post-Shevchenko era. In addition to his poetry, he was a prose writer, playwright, critic, literary
                historian,
                translator, and publisher. His literary themes were inspired by the life and struggles of his own people
                as well as
                global cultural sources, including Eastern traditions and classical and Renaissance influences. Franko
                served as a
                ‘golden bridge’ between Ukrainian
                and world literatures. (

              Vasyl Stus was born into a peasant family. Shortly after his birth, his family, escaping repression
              against wealthier
              peasants, moved to Stalino (now Donetsk), where his father worked as a laborer. His early exposure to
              poetry came from
              his mother, who sang Ukrainian folk songs to him. He started school in 1944 and later enrolled in the
              History, Language,
              and Literature Faculty at the Stalino (now Donetsk) Teachers' Training Institute, graduating in 1959.
              After graduating,
              he taught Ukrainian Language and Literature at Tauzhnye school in the Kirovohrad region, followed by two
              years of
              military service in the Urals.

            <p>
              During his studies and military service, Vasyl Stus began writing poetry. He was proficient in German, and
              during this
              period, he explored the works of German poets Goethe and Rilke, translating around a hundred of their
              pieces.
              Unfortunately, these translations were later seized and lost. <br />
              After completing his military service, Stus worked as a literary editor for the newspaper
              Sotsialistychesky Donbas
              [Socialist Donbas]. In 1963, he began PhD studies at the Shevchenko Institute of Literature within the
              Academy of
              Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, focusing on the “Theory of Literature.” Starting in 1964, he was employed
              at the State
              History Archive of Ukraine.

              <br /><br />
              "The period after military service was a time of poetry. It
              was the age of Pasternak and unquestioningly intense love for
              him … These days I prefer Goethe, (Volodymyr) Svidzinsky,
              Rilke. The Italians are wonderful (those that I know).
              Particularly – Ungaretti, Quasimodo. I also like “thick prose”
              – Tolstoy, Hemingway, Stefanik, Proust, Camus, Faulkner … I
              don’t consider myself to be a poet. I see myself as a person
              who writes poems. Some of them – I think – have something in
              them”, he wrote in an address to his readers in 1969.

                On September 4, 1965, the premiere of Serhiy Parajanov's film "Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors" at Kyiv's
                "Ukraina"
                Cinema unexpectedly turned into a public protest against the repression of the Ukrainian intelligentsia.
                The film crew,
                including Parajanov, journalist Viacheslav Chornovil, and writer Ivan Dziuba, were present in the
                audience. During the
                event, a microphone was used to declare: “The reaction of 1937 has arrived. Now the arrests of
                intellectuals—writers,
                poets, and artists—are taking place in Ukraine.” Stus and Chornovil then addressed the audience, urging
                those opposed to
                tyranny to stand up, and they were the first to do so. Security personnel soon entered the hall,
                plainclothes officers
                surrounded the cinema, and arrests began. This event marked the beginning of a two-decade period of
                intensified
                censorship and arrests, as well as Stus’s active involvement in the Sixties movement. <br /><br />

                As a result of this protest, Stus was expelled from his PhD program and dismissed from his position at
                the State History
                Archive. Subsequently, he took on various jobs, including working on a construction site, as a stoker,
                and as a
                technical information engineer in a design bureau. Despite these challenging circumstances, these years
                were marked by
                intense creative activity, during which he focused on poetry, translations, criticism, and began his
                first attempts at
                prose writing.

                Despite the constant search for income, Despite the constant search for income, this was probably the
                happiest period of Vasyl Stus's life, as in 1965 he married
                his only love, Valentyna Popeliukh. In 1966, they had a son,
                Dmytro, who is now a writer, literary critic, chairman of the
                All-Ukrainian Creative Union “Congress of Writers of Ukraine”
                and director general of the National Taras Shevchenko Museum.

                The writer's son points out that his father continues to face opposition even today: in occupied

                removed a memorial plaque from the university where the poet studied.

              In 1970, Vasyl Stus took a bold stand against the regime by being the first to publicly declare that the
              murder of
              artist, human rights advocate, and dissident Alla Horska was indeed a murder. Officially, the
              investigation claimed she
              was killed by her father-in-law due to personal conflicts, who was later found dead on railroad tracks.
              However, both
              her family and the dissident community believed it was a politically motivated killing. Although evidence
              from the
              investigation and KGB reports later supported the idea of a planned assassination, proving the truth or
              achieving
              justice at that time was impossible. Consequently, Horska's funeral in Kyiv became a protest against the
              Communist
              regime. Stus, a close friend of Horska, carried her portrait at the funeral and wrote a poem titled “In
              Memory of Alla
              Horska” in her honor.

                Vasyl Stus gained increasing prominence for his activism, writing open letters to the Communist Party,
                the Writers'
                Union, and the Verkhovna Rada, where he condemned human rights abuses and the imprisonment of his peers.
                His advocacy,
                however, led to his own arrest. On January 12, 1972, Stus was detained and charged with "anti-Soviet
                agitation and
                propaganda," marking the start of a series of politically motivated arrests known as “Operation Blok” or
                “Arrested
                Carol.”
                <br />
                The writer spent nearly nine months in detention. Subsequently, he was sentenced to five years in prison
                and three years
                in exile in the Magadan and Mordovia labor camps for "anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda."
                <br /><br />
                Occasionally, Stus's poems were seized during random searches, and there was a constant fear that they
                might be
                destroyed, which was one of his greatest trials. He made efforts to send as many of his poems as
                possible to his wife
                through his letters. While he could still manage to do this in Mordovia, it later became impossible. In
                a letter to the
                PEN Club dated September 11, 1976, Stus requested that the organization use its influence to help
                preserve his works,
                including around 200 translations of Goethe and 100 of Rilke's poems. The camp authorities objected to
                his creative
                work, claiming that being in captivity could imbue his lyrical texts with a political tone. Stus
                frequently faced
                punishment in isolation cells and was permitted only one visit throughout his time in the camps.

              <p>
                Stus actively participated in all the protest actions organized by political prisoners. In a letter
                dated August 1,
                1976, addressed to the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, he renounced his Soviet citizenship,
                citing the
                "flagrant violation" of his human rights within the Soviet Union. <br /><br />
                His cellmates were amazed at his enormous erudition and
                knowledge of history, philosophy, and literary criticism. Upon completing his prison term, Stus was
                exiled to the village of Matrosov in the Magadan region, where he spent two
                years working at a gold mine. <br />
                <br />

                He was released in 1979, yet his views remained steadfast and unchanged.

            <div class="pattern pattern-wave"></div>
            <p>
              When Stus returned from prison to Kyiv in the summer of 1979, he
              joined the Ukrainian Helsinki Group of Human Rights Defenders.
              He openly defended the repressed members of the group: <br />
              “In Kyiv, I learned that people close to the Helsinki Group are
              being repressed in the most brutal way. At least, this is how
              Ovsiyenko, Horbal, and Lytvyn were tried, and this is how
              Chornovil and Rozumny were later dealt with. I
              didn’t want that kind of Kyiv. Seeing that the Group had been
              left rudderless, I joined it because I couldn’t do otherwise …
              When life is taken away, I had no need of pitiful crumbs.
              Psychologically I understood that the prison gates had already
              opened for me and that any day now they would close behind me –
              and close for a long time. But what was I supposed to do?
              Ukrainians were not able to leave the country, and anyway I
              didn’t particularly want to go beyond those borders since who
              then, here, in Great Ukraine, would become the voice of
              indignation and protest? This was my fate, and you don’t choose
              your fate. You accept it, whatever that fate may be. And when
              you don’t accept it, it takes you by force … However I had no
              intention of bowing my head down, whatever happened. Behind me
              was Ukraine, my oppressed people, whose honour I had to defend
              or perish”. (“Z tabornoho zoshyta” [“From the camp notebook”],
              1983).

            <p>
              On May 14, 1980, Stus was arrested once more and sent to one of the harsh Perm political labor camps. The
              conditions
              there were brutal, with the administration using every method of oppression against him. He was denied
              visits and
              suffered frequent illnesses. At the start of 1983, he held an 18-day hunger strike and spent an entire
              year in the
              punishment isolation cell. Despite these hardships, Stus continued to write and work on translations. He
              planned to
              compile approximately 250 poems written in free verse and 250 translations into a book titled Ptakh dushi
              ("Bird of the
              Soul"), but everything he wrote was quickly confiscated. The fate of these texts remains uncertain;
              according to an
              official response to his family's inquiries, the works were destroyed when the camp was closed down. In
              1983, Stus
              managed to smuggle out the text of Z taborovoho zoshyta ("From the Camp Notebook"). After this work was
              published in the
              West, and particularly after Heinrich Böll nominated Stus for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1985, the
              pressure on him
              increased even further. <br /><br />
              On August 28, 1985, Vasyl Stus was once again placed in an isolation cell, where he began a hunger strike,
              vowing to
              continue "to the end" in protest. He passed away during the night of September 3-4, 1985. Official reports
              to his family
              claimed that he died of a "heart disorder." Stus was buried in the camp cemetery in the village of
              Borysovo, Chusovsk
              district.

              A famous Ukrainian poet who died young, left behind a remarkable legacy and gained extraordinary fame in
              the literary world. He was often
              referred to as "a poet without a stone in his soul," a phrase that captures his inner purity and profound

                Vasyl Symonenko was raised without a father, with only his mother and grey-haired grandfather as close
                family. His
                childhood was marked by hardship and sorrow, experiences that deeply influenced and were reflected in
                his artistic work. <br /><br />
                Vasyl Symonenko excelled in school, earning a gold medal for his achievements. He later enrolled in the
                Faculty of
                Journalism at Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv. After graduating, he moved to Cherkasy,
                where he worked in
                the editorial offices of the newspapers "Molod Cherkasy," "Robitnycha Hazeta," and "Cherkaska Pravda."

                <br /><br />
                At "Cherkaska Pravda," Symonenko met the love of his life, Lyusia, who worked there as a courier. At 22,
                the poet
                married her, and they later welcomed a son, Oles.

              In the spring of 1960, the Club of Creative Youth was established in Kyiv, with prominent figures like
              Ivan Drach, Alla
              Horska, Lina Kostenko, Vasyl Stus, Mykola Vingranovskyi, Ivan Svitlychnyi, and Yevhen Sverstiuk forming
              its core. Vasyl
              Symonenko was also an active member, traveling across Ukraine and participating in literary evenings and
              discussions. <br /><br />
              The Club of Creative Youth initiated efforts to uncover mass graves of victims of Stalinist repression,
              and Vasyl
              Symonenko actively participated in gathering evidence of this tragedy. He personally traveled around
              Kyiv's
              neighborhoods, searching for witnesses. It was during this time that the locations of secret mass graves
              were discovered
              for the first time at the Lukianivka and Vasylkiv cemeteries, as well as in the forests surrounding Kyiv.
              <br /><br />
              Symonenko was profoundly shocked when he witnessed boys playing soccer in the Bykivnia forest, using a
              skull with a hole
              in the back as their ball and marking the goal line with two more skulls. Les Taniuk, who accompanied
              Symonenko and Alla
              Horska to Bykivnia, recorded this incident in his diary. Following this, Symonenko and other members of
              the Club wrote
              and submitted a memorandum to the Kyiv City Council, urging that the mass graves be publicly acknowledged
              and
              transformed into national sites of mourning and remembrance. This bold act led to Symonenko being placed
              under
              surveillance by the authorities.

                Vasyl Symonenko started writing during his student years. However, during his lifetime, only a
                collection of poetry
                titled "Silence and Thunder" (1962) and a children's fairy tale "King Plaksiy and Loskoton" were
                published. The poems
                that were permitted for publication were heavily edited. True recognition came to the poet after his
                death. Symonenko
                described his poetic style by saying, "There is something in me from grandfather Taras [Shevchenko] and
                great-grandfather Skovoroda." <br /><br />
                Already in those years, Vasyl Symonenko's self-published collections gained significant popularity. They
                became a cornerstone of the Ukrainian
                resistance movement of the 1960s and 1970s. His works sharply criticized the Soviet system (e.g.,
                “Obituary for a
                Corncob,” “The Thief,” “The Trial,” “The Ballad of an Extra Husband”), depicted the harsh realities of
                life in the
                Soviet Union, particularly for the peasantry (e.g., “Thought of Happiness,” “Lonely Mother”), exposed
                the brutality of
                Soviet despotism (e.g., “The Gate,” “Granite Obelisks Like Jellyfish…”), challenged Russian imperial
                chauvinism (e.g.,
                “To Kurdish Brother”), and expressed his deep love for Ukraine (e.g., “Looking into Your Pupils,” “There
                Are a Thousand
                Roads,” “Ukrainian Lion,” “Swans of Motherhood,” “Ukraine” and others). </p>

                Critics contend that Symonenko’s self-published work became emblematic of the fight for Ukraine’s
                statehood and cultural
                sovereignty during the latter half of the 20th century. Despite this, the full extent of the poet’s
                literary legacy
                remains unclear. In Ukraine, his poems were published only to a limited degree and often in altered
                forms. However, his
                self-published poetry circulated abroad and was featured in the magazine Modernity (Part 1, 1965) and
                the collections
                The Coast of Expectations (1965 and 1973). Following Symonenko’s death, the Ukrainian SSR released his
                fairy tale
                Journey to the Country Opposite (1964), the poetry collection Earth’s Attraction (1964), the selection
                of poems Poetry
                (1966), and the short story collection Wine from Roses (1965). Some of his short stories were also
                included in the
                second edition of The Shore of Expectations published abroad.

                In the summer of 1962, Vasyl Symonenko was arrested following a confrontation with a cigarette seller at
                the Cherkasy
                railway station. The incident occurred shortly before the lunch break when Symonenko attempted to buy
                cigarettes, but
                the seller refused to serve him. This refusal infuriated Symonenko. <br />
                Two policemen intervened in the argument and demanded that Vasyl Symonenko show his identification. When
                he presented
                his editorial ID, the officers recognized him but still brazenly detained him in front of bystanders and
                led him to the
                police station at the railway terminal. Subsequently, Symonenko was placed in a police car and taken
                away. The following
                day, his colleagues discovered him in a prison cell in the city of Smila. He was only released after the
                secretary of
                the Smila city party committee intervened. Upon his release, Symonenko had visible bruises and
                complained of severe
                pain, stating that he had been beaten primarily on his spine and lower back. He frequently suffered from
                intense pain in
                his internal organs after this incident, but no effort was made to hold those responsible for the
                beating accountable. <br /><br />
                In the spring of 1963, Vasyl Symonenko's health significantly worsened, and by September, he was
                hospitalized. Doctors
                diagnosed him with kidney cancer, a condition that was likely exacerbated by the beatings he had endured
                at the hands of
                the police. Despite undergoing surgery, his health did not improve. On the night of December 14, 1963,
                at just 28 years
                old, Symonenko passed away in a hospital in Cherkasy. During his funeral, his friends managed to secure
                his diaries and
                archives, but despite their efforts, his works remained unpublished in Ukraine for the next 15 years.

              Vasyl Symonenko earned the title of a literary rebel for good reason: he refused to tolerate injustice and
              was a fervent

              The Kotlyarevsky family was considered noble. They have some land, some serfs, who were later released by
              the writer. Primary education Ivan Kotlyarevsky received from the small clerk, and from 1780 to 1789 he
              studied at the Poltava Theological Seminary. Even then, capable young man wrote poetry, so he was
              nicknamed "the Rhymer". He lived modestly. He read a lot, was distinguished by diligence and perseverance,
              had a gift for drawing, stories, especially humorous, beautifully played the violin. From 1789 to 1793 he
              worked as a clerk, and from 1793 to 1796 - a tutor in wealthy families in Poltava. Here he plunges into
              the elements of folk art - is at different people's fun, studying folk songs, rituals, customs, language,
              and record everything useful, and somewhere around 1794 he unfolds his literary activity.

              Poltava at that time, as biographers of Kotlyarevsky remembered, had approximately 8,000 inhabitants and
              resembled a village. It was the county town. Time for Ukrainian people then was difficult. Ukraine,
              joining russia, had completely lost its independence. In 1764 the hetmanship was canceled, and in 1775
              Zaporozhye - the last bastion of Cossack's liberty, was eliminated. Cossacks did not have the strength any
              more. Their foreman basically abdicated its people and language and went to the russian nobility while the
              peasantry was simply turned into serfs. "Aeneid" by Ivan Kotlyarevsky appeared at a time when the
              historical circumstances have called into question the further future of the Ukrainian language, as well
              as the entire Ukrainian culture. <br><br>
              Back in 1794-1796, Ivan Kotliarevsky prepared the first three parts of the poem "Aeneid", written on the
              plot of the Roman poet Publius Virgil's work of the same name.
              A handwritten copy of the poem ended up with the Konotop landowner Maksym Parpura, who was in charge of
              the printing house of the Medical Board in St. Petersburg. Maksym Parpura published "Aeneid" in 1798 in
              St. Petersburg without Ivan Kotliarevskyi's knowledge, while he was in military service. Ivan Kotliarevsky
              was furious about this.

              <br><br> Meanwhile, "Aeneid" became the first work written in the living spoken Ukrainian language. The
              poem marked the beginning of a new Ukrainian literature based exclusively on the spoken Ukrainian
              language. "'Aeneid" became popular even in manuscripts and has not lost the love of readers to this day.
              In the more than 220 years since its first publication, the work has been translated into dozens of
              languages, filmed, and a significant number of literary, musical, theatrical, and artistic works have been
              created based on it.

            <p> At the age of 27, Kotliarevsky consciously joined the armed forces of the time. In 1806-1807, he, with
              the rank of staff captain, took part in the russo-Turkish War, participated in the siege of Izmail, and
              was awarded the Order of St. Anne, 3rd class, for his diplomatic services in persuading the Budzhak Tatars
              to neutrality and courageous courier work on the front line. Although he retired in 1808, his military
              career did not end there. <br><br>

              During Napoleon I Bonaparte's campaign against russia, Kotliarevsky formed the 5th Ukrainian Cossack
              Regiment in the town of Horoshyn in Poltava region and led it. At the time, Cossack military units were
              recruited in the Buh Cossack Army, as well as in the territories of Kyiv, Podillia, Chernihiv, and Poltava
              provinces, with the involvement of retired officers on the promise of reviving the Zaporozhian Army as a
              military formation that would remain in place in the future. <br><br>

            </div>
            <p>Senator Mykhailo Miklashevsky drew up a project for the organisation of Cossack regiments. Influential
              Ukrainian figures Dmytro Troshchynskyi and Vasyl Kapnist advocated to the governor-general that these
              regiments be given a Ukrainian character. In total, twice as many units were formed as planned, 14 units
              with a total of 66,228 soldiers. An interesting detail is that the Cossacks were armed, bought uniforms
              and maintained mainly at the expense of private rather than public funds. According to I. Kotliarevsky,
              "people joined the Cossacks with pleasure, willingly and without the slightest regret", which was never
              the case during regular recruitment. <br><br> In 1813-1815, some Cossack regiments took part in the
              struggle against Napoleon's army in Central and Western Europe, in particular during the capture of Paris.
              Thus, in 1813 Kotliarevsky was sent to Dresden with dispatches, and in 1813 and 1814 he visited St.
              Petersburg twice. Kotliarevsky was rewarded for his 25 years of service with the rank of major, a diamond
              ring, and a 500-ruble pension. <br>

              <br><br> However, as soon as the war ended, the imperial authorities immediately disbanded the Cossack
              army, seeing its continued existence as a threat to them. The liquidation of the Cossack army caused a
              large wave of uprisings. In particular, in Podillia, demobilised soldiers joined Ustym Karmaliuk's
              uprising against the russian administration and nobility, and in southern Ukraine, the Buh Cossack army
              rebelled.

            <p>In 1810, after his military service, Ivan Kotliarevsky returned to Poltava. Here he took up the position
              of supervisor of the House for the Education of Poor Nobles. One of Ivan Kotliarevsky's pupils at the
              institution was Mykhailo Ostrohradsky, who would later become a leading mathematician, mechanic and
              physicist, as well as the Ukrainian painter Apollo Mokrytsky, a student of Karl Bryullov and a friend of
              Taras Shevchenko. <br><br>
              In 1818-1821, Ivan Kotliarevsky served as the chief director of the Poltava Free Theatre, the first
              professional theatre in Ukraine (officially, the theatre's director was the musical theorist and conductor
              M. Hauptmann, but the actual director was his deputy, I. Kotliarevsky). It was for this theatre that
              "Natalka Poltavka" and "Moskal the Magician" were written in 1819, which became the basis for the launch
              of a new Ukrainian drama. And Mykola Lysenko created the opera "Natalka Poltavka". Kotliarevsky himself
              played comic roles in the theatre since its foundation. </p>

            <p class="last-p"> The leading actor and stage reformer Mykhailo Shchepkin (1788-1863) was redeemed from
              serfdom in 1821 by the advanced Poltava community with the direct participation of I. Kotliarevsky, who,
              despite his active creative work, was not abandoned by his free thinking. <br><br>
              Ivan Kotliarevsky died unmarried, releasing two families of his serfs and giving away 60 acres of land to
              relatives and friends. Since Kotliarevsky had no direct descendants, his heir and the owner of the estate
              was the housekeeper Motrona Veklevycheva.

              Lina Kostenko is considered a genius of words, an iron woman and a living legend. Her works offered

              <p class="artist-first-p">
                Lina Kostenko was born in Rzhyshchiv to a family of educators. In the 1930s, her father was imprisoned in the Gulag as
                an "enemy of the people." After World War II, she graduated from the Kyiv Pedagogical Institute and then from the Maxim
                Gorky Literature Institute in moscow in 1956. Her debut poetry collection, "Rays of the Earth", was published in 1957,
                followed by "Sails" in 1958 and "Wanderings of the Heart" in 1961. Although literary experts and critics anticipated a
                bright future for her, her collection "Star Integral" was abruptly banned by Soviet censors due to her political stance. <br><br>

                In the early 1960s, Kostenko participated in literary evenings organized by the “Klub tvorchoyi molodi” (Club for
                Creative Young People, CCY). During this period, her poems were published in Czechoslovakian journals and Polish
                newspapers through translations by V. Voroshylsky. In Ukraine, her work appeared only occasionally in official
                publications but was widely circulated in samizdat. <br><br>

                Her next collection, "Knyazha Hora", was also withdrawn
                from the
                layout. Contemporaries say that it was probably only one poem about Ukraine that was not pleasing
                because
                it was "not
                Soviet enough".

                But the stubborn Kostenko did not make any concessions: "Either the collection will contain this poem,
                or
                there
                will be no
                collection!" <br> <br>
                And there were no more collections. Lina Kostenko's name was tabooed in the publishing world, and she
                was
                forced
                to write "in
                a drawer" for 16 years. </p>

                Lina Kostenko was one of the leaders of the Sixties movement and attended the trials of dissidents who
                were accused of
                "anti-Soviet activities and propaganda". </p>

              <p> The trial of the Horyn brothers in Lviv was a memorable one. A whole delegation of Ukrainian
                intelligentsia came from
                Kyiv to attend the closed session. Although they could not influence the verdict, the moral significance
                of their
                protest was enormous. <br><br>

                Lina Kostenko and Ivan Drach also organised an appeal from Lviv writers to bail out Bohdan Horyn, the
                youngest of the
                arrested. After that, Natalka Pozniak-Khomenko writes, a polite young man from the "competent
                authorities" came to her
                and invited her to the KGB for a conversation.

                "Is this an invitation or an order?" the writer asked. "Of course it's an invitation," he replied. "Then
                let me not use
                it," Kostenko replied and closed the door. <br><br>

                Leaving her daughter with her parents and risking not returning to her, Kostenko travelled to protest
                against the Soviet
                invasion of Czechoslovakia. <br><br>

                Kostenko's speech at the Writers' Union in 1966, when the traditional ceremony of stigmatising "national
                dissidents"
                took place, also became legendary. At that time, the writer openly supported Ivan Svitlychnyi, Opanas
                Zalyvakha,
                Mykhailo Kosiv, and the Horyn brothers, which caused a flurry of applause from young people.
                <br> <br>
                Later, she wrote an open letter to the newspaper Literaturna Ukraina in defence of Chornovil. Of course,
                it was not
                published, but Kostenko received the final taboo on her own work.

                Lina Kostenko travelled to the Chornobyl exclusion zone after the Chornobyl nuclear power plant
                catastrophe, risking her
                health - she took part in various expeditions that, in her words, "removed the posthumous mask" from
                that
                land. <br><br>
                "You may ask, 'How can you love the Zone? How can you not love it? Does it make you love your mother any
                less because
                she's dead? On the contrary, more, deeper, repentantly, because it is love multiplied by the pain of
                irreparable loss,"
                Lina Kostenko wrote. <br><br>
                She also spoke about the Chornobyl catastrophe in her infrequent public speeches in the early 2000s,
                which immediately
                became resonant. And when she was invited to a television programme, she invited the film crew to the
                Ovruch district
                and spent most of the programme talking about the Zone.

            <p> Kostenko was able to return to her readers only in 1977: her collection of poems "Over the Banks of the
              Eternal River"
              was published then, and in 1979, she published a historical novel in verse " Marusia Churai", which had
              been waiting for
              its release for 6 years. For this novel, the poet received the Taras Shevchenko State Prize.

                For 10 years,
                she disappeared from the public space of Ukraine on her own accord. She refused the title of Hero of

              Wings <br><br>
              In truth, the winged need no land: <br>
              Without the ground, there’ll be the sky,<br>
              Without fog, there’ll be clouds, <br>
              Without land, there will be freedom. <br>
              In this, perhaps, is their avian truth. <br>
              And what about humans? <br>
              They live on land and do not fly. <br>
              Still, they have wings! They truly do. <br>
              Those wings, instead of quills and fluff, <br>
              Are made of virtue, truth, and trust. <br>
              Some have wings of faithful love, <br>
              Some – of endless aspiration, <br>
              Some – of empathy and action, <br>
              Some – of zeal and pride in work, <br>
              Some – of poetry and song, <br>
              Of art, hope, dreams, and passion… <br>
              They do not fly – or so it seems. <br>
              But they have wings! They do have wings! <br>
